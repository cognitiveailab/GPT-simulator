    "space-walk": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based space walk simulation game, winning or losing the game, as well as how game scores are earned, are determined by specific conditions and actions taken by the player. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### How to Win:\n- **Winning Condition**: The player wins the game by successfully moving to the \"outer space\" room. This is achieved by navigating through the spaceship, wearing a space suit, opening the airlock door, and moving into outer space. The `calculateScore` function sets the score to 1, marks the game as over (`self.gameOver = True`), and flags the game as won (`self.gameWon = True`) when the player is in the \"outer space\" room.\n\n### How to Lose:\n- **Losing Condition 1**: The player loses the game if they move into outer space without wearing a space suit. The `tick` method of the `Agent` class checks if the agent is in a room that connects to outer space without wearing a space suit (`self.getProperty(\"wearSpaceSuit\")` is `False`), and if so, sets the agent's `die` property to `True`. The `calculateScore` function then sets the score to 0, marks the game as over, and flags the game as not won when the `die` property is `True`.\n- **Losing Condition 2**: The player also loses the game if the spaceship directly connects to outer space, which is checked by the `calculateScore` function through the `connectsToOuterSpace` method of the `Room` class. If any room directly connects to outer space (indicating a failure in properly managing the airlock doors), the score is set to 0, the game is marked as over, and the game is flagged as not won.\n\n### Earning Scores:\n- **Initial Score**: The initial score is set to 0 when the game starts.\n- **Winning Score**: The score is set to 1 when the player successfully completes the game by reaching outer space with the space suit on. This is the only condition under which the player earns a score.\n- **Losing Score**: The score remains at 0 if the player loses the game by either dying (moving into outer space without a space suit) or causing the spaceship to directly connect to outer space.\n\n### Summary:\nTo win the game and earn a score of 1, the player must:\n1. Take the space suit from the spaceship.\n2. Wear the space suit.\n3. Navigate through the spaceship to the airlock.\n4. Open the airlock door.\n5. Move into the airlock and close the door behind them.\n6. Open the outer door to outer space.\n7. Move into outer space.\n\nFailing to wear the space suit before moving into outer space or improperly managing the airlock doors results in losing the game with a score of 0.",

Turn on the sink to fill the measuring cup with water to a certain level.\n4. Turn off the sink.\n5. Note the volume of water in the measuring cup.\n6. Take the stone and put it in the measuring cup with water.\n7. Observe the new water level in the measuring cup, which has risen due to the displacement caused by the stone.\n8. Calculate the volume of the stone based on the difference in water levels before and after placing the stone in the measuring cup.\n9. Answer with the calculated volume of the stone.\n\n### Losing the Game:\nThe player loses the game if they answer with an incorrect volume for the stone. The game is designed to end once the player submits their answer, with the outcome depending on the accuracy of their answer.\n\n### Earning Scores:\nThe game's scoring mechanism is straightforward. The `calculateScore` function in the `TextGame` class determines the score based on the player's answer:\n- If the player's answer matches the randomly generated volume of the stone (set during the world initialization), the player's score is increased by 1, the `gameOver` flag is set to `True`, and the `gameWon` flag is also set to `True`, indicating a win.\n- If the player's answer does not match the stone's volume, the score remains 0, the `gameOver` flag is set to `True`, and the `gameWon` flag is set to `False`, indicating a loss.\n\n### Summary:\nThe game is won by accurately determining and answering the volume of the stone through the displacement method using a measuring cup and water. The score is binary, based solely on whether the player's answer is correct or not, with no partial scores for incorrect answers.",
    "cooking": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based cooking game, the game can be won or lost, and scores can be earned through various actions as detailed below:\n\n### How the Game Can Be Won:\n- The game is won by successfully preparing a meal according to the instructions found in the cook book. This involves taking the cook book, reading it to understand the required ingredients and their preparation methods (cutting and cooking), collecting and preparing these ingredients correctly, and finally, taking the action to prepare the meal.\n- The game checks if all ingredients are in the player's inventory, if they are cut and cooked according to the receipt from the cook book, and if the player has taken the action to prepare the meal. If all these conditions are met and the player's actions match the receipt exactly, the game is won.\n\n### How the Game Can Be Lost:\n- The game is lost if the player incorrectly prepares any of the ingredients, either by cutting or cooking them in a way not specified in the cook book. This results in an immediate game over, indicating the player has lost.\n\n### How Game Scores Can Be Earned:\n- The game score is calculated based on the actions taken by the player in relation to the ingredients and their preparation. The `calculateScore` function plays a crucial role in this process.\n- Players earn a portion of the score for each ingredient they correctly take into their inventory as specified in the cook book.\n- Additional portions of the score are earned for each ingredient that is correctly prepared, either by cutting or cooking, as per the cook book's instructions.\n- The score is calculated as a fraction of the total number of correct actions (taking, cutting, and cooking the right ingredients) over the total number of actions that could earn a reward (as determined by the `full_mark` variable, which is incremented for each correct action possible based on the cook book's receipt).\n- The final action of preparing the meal, if done correctly with all ingredients prepared as required, adds to the score, and the score is then divided by the `full_mark + 1` to get a normalized score between 0 and 1, which is then rounded to two decimal places.\n\nIn summary, to win the game and earn the highest score, the player must carefully follow the cook book's instructions, correctly prepare all ingredients, and choose to prepare the meal only when everything is ready. Incorrect preparation of any ingredient results in an immediate loss, emphasizing the importance of attention to detail in this cooking simulation game.",
    "wash-clothes": "Based on the provided code for the text game, winning or losing the game, as well as how game scores are earned, can be determined by examining the `calculateScore` method within the `TextGame` class. Here's a breakdown of the game's win/lose conditions and scoring mechanism:\n\n### Winning the Game:\n- The game is won when all clothes are clean, dry, and placed in the basket (referred to as the `answer_box` in the code).\n- The `calculateScore` method iterates through all objects in the game world to check if any object is of type `Clothes`. For each piece of clothing, it checks if the clothes are not dirty (`isDirty` property is `False`), not wet (`isWet` property is `False`), and are located inside the basket (`parentContainer` is the `answer_box`).\n- If all clothes meet these conditions, the game is considered complete, the score is set to 1, `gameOver` is set to `True`, and `gameWon` is also set to `True`.\n\n### Losing the Game:\n- The code does not explicitly define a losing condition in terms of game mechanics (e.g., running out of moves or making an irreversible mistake). The game ends when the player successfully completes the task or when the player decides to quit.\n- However, not meeting the winning conditions (i.e., not all clothes are clean, dry, and in the basket) by the time the player decides to stop playing could be considered not winning or losing the game.\n\n### Earning Scores:\n- The game's scoring is binary, based on the completion of the task. The player starts with a score of 0.\n- The score becomes 1 only when the player successfully completes the game by meeting the winning conditions mentioned above. There are no partial scores for partially completing the task (e.g., only washing but not drying the clothes, or not placing them in the basket).\n- The `calculateScore` method is called after each action to check if the winning conditions are met.\n\n### Summary:\nTo win the game and earn a score of 1, a player must:\n1. Put all dirty clothes into the washing machine.\n2. Add detergent to the washing machine.\n3. Turn on the washing machine and wait for the cycle to finish, ensuring the clothes become clean and wet.\n4. Transfer the wet clothes to the dryer.\n5. Turn on the dryer and wait for the cycle to finish, ensuring the clothes become dry.\n6. Place all the clean, dry clothes into the basket.\n\nFailing to complete all these steps before stopping the game means the player does not win, and the score remains at 0.",
    "bird-life-cycle": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game simulates the life cycle of a bird from an egg to an adult bird. The player acts as a mother bird whose task is to hatch the egg and raise the baby bird until it becomes an adult. The game is won when the bird reaches the \"adult bird\" stage, and it can be lost if the egg or young bird dies due to neglect (not being kept warm or fed, respectively).\n\n### Winning the Game:\n- **Win Condition:** The game is won when there is an adult bird in the nest that is not the player (the agent). This is determined in the `calculateScore` function, where if an object of type `Bird` (excluding the `Agent`) has a property `\"stage\"` equal to `\"adult bird\"`, the score is incremented by 1, `gameOver` is set to `True`, and `gameWon` is set to `True`.\n\n### Losing the Game:\n- **Lose Condition:** The game is lost if the egg does not hatch in time or if the young bird dies of hunger. This is checked in the `calculateScore` function, where if any object has a property `\"food\"` equal to `0`, the score is set to `0`, `gameOver` is set to `True`, and `gameWon` is set to `False`.\n\n### Earning Scores:\n- **Score Calculation:** The score is calculated based on the successful raising of the bird to adulthood. The `calculateScore` function sets the score to `0` at the beginning of its execution and only increases the score if an adult bird is present, indicating the player has successfully completed the game's objective. If the conditions for losing the game are met (egg not hatched in time or young bird dies of hunger), the score is reset to `0`, and the game ends without a win.\n\n### Game Actions and Their Effects:\n- **Actions:** The game allows several actions, including \"look around\", \"inventory\", \"sing\", \"fly around\", \"sit on [object]\", and \"feed [object]\". The last two actions are critical for winning the game:\n  - **\"sit on [object]\"**: This action is used to sit on the egg, keeping it warm. The egg needs to be kept warm to hatch, which is simulated by setting its `\"warm\"` property to `3` when this action is performed.\n  - **\"feed [object]\"**: This action is used to feed the young bird, resetting its `\"food\"` property to `3`. The young bird needs to be fed to survive and grow into an adult bird.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo win the game, the player must perform the actions of sitting on the egg until it hatches and then feeding the young bird until it grows into an adult. Failure to perform these actions in a timely manner will result in losing the game. The game's score reflects the player's success in raising the bird, with a win condition tied to the presence of an adult bird in the nest.",
    "forge-key": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won by successfully forging a key from a copper ingot and using it to open a locked door. The game involves a series of actions that the player must perform correctly, including heating the copper ingot in a foundry, pouring the molten copper into a key mold, waiting for it to cool down, and then using the newly forged copper key to unlock and open the door.\n\nThe game's scoring mechanism is determined by the `calculateScore` function within the `TextGame` class. The function sets the game score based on whether the door in the game is open. If the door is open, the score is set to 1, indicating that the player has successfully completed the game's main objective. Additionally, when the door is opened, the `gameOver` flag is set to `True`, and the `gameWon` flag is also set to `True`, marking the end of the game and a win for the player.\n\nThere are no other explicit scoring mechanisms or points awarded for intermediate steps in the game, such as successfully melting the copper or pouring it into the mold. The sole criterion for winning the game and earning a score is opening the door, which signifies that the player has successfully forged the key and completed the game's main task.\n\nIn summary, to win the game and earn a score, the player must:\n1. Take the copper ingot and put it in the foundry.\n2. Turn on the foundry and wait until the copper melts.\n3. Pour the molten copper into the key mold.\n4. Wait until the copper cools down and solidifies into a key.\n5. Take the copper key.\n6. Use the copper key to open the locked door.\n\nOnce the door is opened, the player wins the game, the score is set to 1, and the game ends.",
    "sunburn": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won or lost based on the player's actions, particularly in relation to using sunscreen and moving a ball to a specific location. The game's scoring mechanism is determined by the `calculateScore` method within the `TextGame` class. Here's a breakdown of how the game can be won or lost and how scores are earned:\n\n### Winning the Game:\n- The primary objective is to take a ball from the beach and put it in a box in the house while protecting oneself from sunburn.\n- To win the game, the player must use the sunscreen before going outdoors to the beach to prevent getting sunburned. This is critical because getting sunburned results in losing the game.\n- After using the sunscreen, the player needs to move to the beach, take the ball, return to the house, and put the ball into the box.\n- If these steps are successfully completed without the player getting sunburned (i.e., the `sunburn` property of the `Agent` class is `False`), the game is won. The `calculateScore` method sets the score to 1, the `gameOver` flag to `True`, and the `gameWon` flag to `True`.\n\n### Losing the Game:\n- The player loses the game if they get sunburned. This happens if the player goes outdoors without using the sunscreen. The `tick` method of the `Agent` class checks if the agent is outdoors and hasn't used sunscreen, setting the `sunburn` property to `True`.\n- If the `sunburn` property is `True`, the `calculateScore` method sets the score to 0, the `gameOver` flag to `True`, and the `gameWon` flag to `False`.\n\n### Earning Scores:\n- The game's scoring is binary: the player either wins with a score of 1 or loses with a score of 0.\n- The score is determined after each action by the `calculateScore` method. This method checks if the target object (the ball) is in the correct container (the box) and if the player has avoided getting sunburned.\n- If the conditions for winning are met, the score is set to 1. If the player gets sunburned, the score is set to 0, regardless of the ball's location.\n\n### Summary:\nThe game is won by using sunscreen, taking the ball from the beach, and placing it in the box in the house without getting sunburned. The game is lost if the player gets sunburned. The scoring is straightforward: 1 for winning and 0 for losing.",
    "metal-detector": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won by finding and taking a \"metal case\" into the player's inventory. The game simulates a beach environment where the player can move around, use a metal detector to find buried items, and dig them up using a shovel. The primary objective is to locate and retrieve a buried metal case.\n\n### Winning the Game:\nTo win the game, the player must:\n1. Take the shovel and metal detector available in the initial room.\n2. Move around the beach (which is represented as a 3x3 grid of rooms) to explore different areas.\n3. Use the metal detector in various rooms to detect if there is a buried metal item. If the detector pings, it indicates the presence of a metal item in the current room.\n4. Use the shovel to dig in the room where the metal detector pings, which will uncover the buried items.\n5. Find and take the \"metal case\" into the inventory.\n\n### Losing the Game:\nThe game does not explicitly define a losing condition in the provided code. However, the player can fail to achieve the game's objective by not finding the metal case or potentially by breaking the shovel before finding the case (if the shovel's durability is considered and implemented in such a way that it can break after a certain number of uses, which is hinted at but not fully implemented in the provided code).\n\n### Earning Scores:\nThe game's scoring mechanism is simple and is based on whether the player has successfully found and taken the metal case. The `calculateScore` function in the `TextGame` class checks if the target item (the metal case) is in the player's inventory. If the metal case is in the player's inventory, the score is set to 1, the `gameOver` flag is set to True, and the `gameWon` flag is also set to True. This indicates that the player has won the game. There are no other mechanisms for earning scores in the provided code, meaning the score is binary: the player either wins by finding the metal case (score = 1) or does not win (score = 0).\n\n### Summary:\nThe game is won by successfully finding and taking the metal case into the player's inventory. The score is binary, based solely on the successful retrieval of the metal case. There are no explicit losing conditions defined in the code, other than potentially failing to achieve the game's objective.",
    "use-bandage": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won by successfully placing bandages on all body parts that have wounds. The game environment is set in a bathroom, and the player interacts with various objects, including a BandageBox, Bandages, a Person, and BodyParts, to achieve this goal. The game involves opening the BandageBox, taking a Bandage, and putting it on the wounded BodyPart of the Person.\n\nThe game's scoring mechanism is determined by the `calculateScore` function within the `TextGame` class. Here's how the scoring works based on the function's logic:\n\n1. **Baseline Score**: The score starts at 0. The game does not have a mechanism to decrease the score based on the provided code snippet, so the score can only increase or remain the same throughout the game.\n\n2. **Scoring for Bandaging Wounds**: The game iterates through all objects in the game world to find instances of the `BodyPart` class. For each `BodyPart` that has a wound (`hasWound` property is `True`), the game checks if there is a `Bandage` object contained within it. If a `Bandage` is found on a wounded `BodyPart`, the score is increased by 1. This means that for every correct application of a bandage on a wounded body part, the player earns 1 point.\n\n3. **Winning Condition**: The game is won (`gameWon` is set to `True`) when all wounded body parts have bandages on them. This is determined by checking if there are any body parts with wounds that do not have bandages. If there are no such body parts left, the game sets `gameOver` to `True` and `gameWon` to `True`, indicating that the player has successfully completed the game's objective.\n\n4. **Game Over**: The game ends when the winning condition is met, which is when all wounds have been bandaged. The `gameOver` flag is set to `True`, and depending on whether all wounds are bandaged, `gameWon` may also be set to `True`.\n\nIn summary, to win the game and achieve the highest score, the player must efficiently use the bandages to cover all wounds on the body parts of the person in the game. Each successful application of a bandage on a wound contributes to the score, and covering all wounds successfully concludes the game with a win.",
    "balance-scale-weigh": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game revolves around the player figuring out the weight of a cube using a balance scale. The game is won or lost based on the player's ability to correctly identify the weight of the cube. Here's how the game can be won or lost and how scores are earned:\n\n### Winning the Game:\n- The player wins the game by correctly guessing the weight of the cube. This is done through the `actionAnswer` method, where the player inputs their guess for the cube's weight.\n- If the guessed weight (`self.answer_mass`) matches the actual weight of the cube (`self.cube_weight`), the game is won (`self.gameWon = True`), the game ends (`self.gameOver = True`), and the player's score is set to 1 (`self.score += 1`).\n\n### Losing the Game:\n- The player loses the game if their guess for the cube's weight is incorrect.\n- If the guessed weight does not match the actual weight of the cube, the game ends (`self.gameOver = True`), but the player does not win (`self.gameWon = False`), and the score remains 0 (`self.score = 0`).\n\n### Earning Scores:\n- Scores are calculated based on the accuracy of the player's guess regarding the cube's weight.\n- The initial score is set to 0 (`self.score = 0`).\n- If the player guesses the weight correctly, the score is increased by 1 (`self.score += 1`).\n- There is no partial scoring or incremental scoring based on actions taken during the game; the score is solely determined by the correctness of the final answer.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n- The game involves placing objects on a balance scale to determine the weight of a cube. The player can interact with objects (e.g., take, put) and use the balance scale to make observations.\n- The player's actions include looking around, managing inventory, taking and placing objects, and ultimately answering the weight of the cube.\n- The game progresses through a series of steps, with the player performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of observations, scores, and game state updates.\n\nIn summary, the game is won by correctly guessing the weight of a cube, with the score being a binary outcome based on the correctness of the guess. The game mechanics involve interacting with a simulated environment to gather information needed to make an informed guess.",

The game simulates an emergency room scenario where the player, acting as a nurse or medical professional, must choose the correct blood type to give to a patient in need of a blood transfusion.\n\n### Winning the Game:\nThe game is won if the player successfully gives the patient a bag of blood that matches the patient's blood type and Rh factor. The game checks if the given blood type is compatible with the patient's blood type using two lookup tables: `blood_type_lut` for the ABO blood group system and `blood_type_rh_lut` for the Rh factor. If the given blood type and Rh factor are compatible with what the patient can receive, the game is won.\n\n### Losing the Game:\nThe game is lost if the player gives the patient a bag of blood that is not compatible with the patient's blood type and Rh factor. If the given blood does not match the patient's requirements based on the lookup tables, the game ends, and the player loses.\n\n### Earning Scores:\nThe game score is calculated based on whether the player successfully completes the task of giving the correct type of blood to the patient. The `calculateScore` function updates the game score, game over flag, and game won flag based on the compatibility of the given blood with the patient's blood type and Rh factor. If the blood given is correct, the score is increased by 1, the game is marked as over (`gameOver = True`), and the game is marked as won (`gameWon = True`). If the blood given is incorrect, the game is marked as over, but the game is marked as lost (`gameWon = False`), and the score does not increase.\n\n### Summary:\nTo win the game, the player must carefully choose a bag of blood that matches the patient's blood type and Rh factor from the available options in the emergency room. The player earns a score by successfully completing this task. The game emphasizes the importance of blood type compatibility in medical treatments, particularly in emergency transfusion scenarios.",
    "volume": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game revolves around measuring the volume of a specific colored box using a ruler and then providing the correct volume as an answer. The game is won by correctly calculating and answering the volume of the target box. Conversely, the game is lost if the player provides an incorrect volume.\n\n### Winning the Game:\nTo win the game, the player must:\n1. Identify the target box by its color, as mentioned in the task description.\n2. Use the ruler to measure the length, width, and height of the target box. This involves taking the ruler from the room, measuring each dimension of the target box, and calculating the volume based on these measurements.\n3. Answer with the correct volume of the target box. The volume is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height of the box.\n\n### Losing the Game:\nThe game is lost if the player answers with an incorrect volume for the target box. Once an answer is provided, if it does not match the actual volume of the target box, the game ends, and the player loses.\n\n### Earning Scores:\nThe scoring mechanism is straightforward. Based on the `calculateScore` function:\n- If the player's answer matches the target box's volume, the score is incremented by 1, the `gameOver` flag is set to True, and the `gameWon` flag is also set to True, indicating a win.\n- If the player's answer does not match the target box's volume, the score remains 0, the `gameOver` flag is set to True, and the `gameWon` flag is set to False, indicating a loss.\n\n### Key Points:\n- The game involves interaction with objects (taking the ruler, measuring dimensions) and calculating the volume based on these interactions.\n- The game is won by correctly answering the volume of the target box.\n- The game is lost by providing an incorrect volume.\n- The score is a binary outcome based on the correctness of the player's answer regarding the target box's volume.",
    "plant-tree": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won by successfully planting a tree and watering it. The high-level solution procedure outlined in the comments suggests the steps needed to win the game:\n\n1. Take a shovel.\n2. Dig a hole with the shovel.\n3. Take the tree.\n4. Put the tree in the hole.\n5. Add soil to the hole.\n6. Take a water container.\n7. Put the water container into the sink.\n8. Turn on the sink to fill the water container.\n9. Take the water container.\n10. Water the tree by pouring water into the soil.\n\nThe game is lost if these steps are not completed correctly or if critical steps are missed, leading to the inability to plant and water the tree properly.\n\nScoring in the game is determined by the `calculateScore` function within the `TextGame` class. The function iterates through all objects in the game world and checks for a specific condition: a hole that contains both a tree and soil, with the soil being wet. This condition represents the successful planting and watering of the tree. If this condition is met, the score is set to 1, the `gameOver` flag is set to True, and the `gameWon` flag is also set to True, indicating that the player has won the game.\n\nThere are no intermediate scores or points awarded for completing individual steps of the task (e.g., digging the hole, planting the tree, etc.). The game's scoring system is binary: the player either wins by achieving the game's objective (score = 1) or does not win (score = 0).\n\nIn summary, to win the game and earn a score, the player must successfully execute a series of actions that result in a tree being planted in a hole with added soil, and the soil must be watered. The game is won by achieving this specific end state, and the score reflects whether or not the player has successfully completed the game's objective.",
    "balance-scale-heaviest": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won or lost based on the player's actions in relation to finding and placing the heaviest cubes into a specified container (referred to as the \"answer box\" in the code). The game involves an environment with a balance scale, cubes of different weights, and a box where the player is supposed to place the heaviest cubes.\n\n### Winning the Game:\nThe game is won when all cubes with the maximum weight are placed inside the answer box. The `calculateScore` method checks if all objects of type `Cube` with the property `weight` equal to `self.max_weight` are located within the `self.answer_box`. If this condition is met and no incorrect cubes (cubes not having the maximum weight) are placed inside the answer box, the game is considered completed successfully, the score is incremented by 1, `self.gameOver` is set to `True`, and `self.gameWon` is also set to `True`.\n\n### Losing the Game:\nThe game is lost if any cube that does not have the maximum weight is placed inside the answer box. In this scenario, the `calculateScore` method sets `self.score` to 0, `self.gameOver` to `True`, and `self.gameWon` to `False`, indicating that the game has been lost.\n\n### Earning Scores:\nThe scoring system is quite straightforward. The player starts with a baseline score of 0. The score is incremented by 1 only when the game is won, which happens when all the heaviest cubes are correctly identified and placed in the answer box without any mistakes. If a wrong cube (a cube that is not one of the heaviest) is placed in the answer box, the score is set to 0, and the game ends in a loss.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n- Players can interact with the game environment by performing actions such as looking around, taking objects, and placing objects in containers.\n- The balance scale can be used to compare the weights of different cubes to find the heaviest ones.\n- The game keeps track of the number of steps taken by the player, but this does not directly influence the scoring or outcome of the game.\n- The game ends either when the player successfully completes the task by placing all the heaviest cubes in the answer box or when the player places any incorrect cube in the answer box.\n\nIn summary, to win the game and earn a score, the player must correctly identify all the heaviest cubes using the balance scale and place only those cubes in the answer box, avoiding any mistakes.",
    "scale-weigh": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won or lost based on the player's ability to correctly determine the weight of a specific object (referred to as the target object) among several objects. The game involves interacting with objects within a virtual environment, specifically taking objects and placing them on a scale to determine their weight. The player's task is to figure out the weight of the target object.\n\n### Winning the Game:\nThe game is won if the player correctly answers the weight of the target object. This is determined in the `calculateScore` method of the `TextGame` class. If the player's answer (`self.answer_weight`) matches the actual weight of the target object (`self.target_weight`), the player's score is increased by 1, the game is marked as over (`self.gameOver = True`), and the game is marked as won (`self.gameWon = True`).\n\n### Losing the Game:\nThe game is lost if the player answers incorrectly. In this case, the score is set to 0, the game is marked as over (`self.gameOver = True`), and the game is marked as not won (`self.gameWon = False`).\n\n### Earning Scores:\nScores are earned based on the accuracy of the player's answer regarding the weight of the target object. The scoring system is binary in this game:\n- Correct Answer: If the player's answer matches the target object's weight, the score is increased by 1.\n- Incorrect Answer: If the player's answer does not match the target object's weight, the score is set to 0.\n\n### Game Mechanics:\n- The game initializes with a random selection of objects (with weights) and a scale. One of these objects is designated as the target object.\n- The player can interact with the game environment through a set of actions, such as looking around, examining objects, taking objects, putting objects on the scale, and answering the weight of the target object.\n- The game keeps track of the number of steps (actions) taken by the player (`self.numSteps`), and the game's state changes based on the player's actions.\n- The game ends when the player submits an answer for the weight of the target object, at which point the game evaluates the answer and determines if the player has won or lost.\n\nIn summary, to win the game, the player must correctly identify the weight of the target object among the objects present in the game environment and answer correctly. The game's challenge lies in determining which object is the target and accurately assessing its weight through interaction with the game's objects and the scale.",
    "sweep-floor": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won by successfully sweeping all the garbage (instances of the `Garbage` class) into the dustpan and then dumping the contents of the dustpan into the garbage can (an instance of the `GarbageCan` class). The game is lost if the player fails to clean up all the garbage within the given environment, although the code does not specify a particular condition for losing beyond not winning.\n\nThe game score is calculated based on whether all garbage has been successfully moved into the garbage can. The `calculateScore` function sets the game score to 1 if all garbage is in the garbage can, indicating that the player has won the game. If there is any garbage not in the garbage can, the game continues without setting a winning condition, and the score remains at 0. The game does not implement a detailed scoring system beyond this binary win condition. The game is marked as over (`self.gameOver = True`) and won (`self.gameWon = True`) when all garbage is in the garbage can.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the game can be won based on the `calculateScore` function:\n\n1. **Winning Condition**: The player must take the broom and the dustpan, sweep all pieces of garbage into the dustpan using the broom, open the garbage can, and then dump the contents of the dustpan into the garbage can. The game checks if all instances of `Garbage` are contained within the `GarbageCan` object. If so, the game is marked as won, `self.gameOver` is set to `True`, `self.gameWon` is set to `True`, and the score is set to 1.\n\n2. **Scoring**: The game's scoring mechanism is very simple. The score is set to 0 by default and is only changed to 1 when the winning condition is met. There are no intermediate scores or penalties for incorrect actions.\n\n3. **Game Over and Winning**: The game is considered over when the winning condition is met, which is when all garbage has been successfully cleaned up. The code does not specify any other conditions for the game to end or for the player to lose.\n\nIn summary, to win the game, the player must perform a series of actions that involve using the broom to sweep garbage into the dustpan and then dumping it into the garbage can. The game is won when all garbage is in the garbage can, at which point the score becomes 1, indicating a successful clean-up.",
    "inclined-plane": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game revolves around comparing the friction of two inclined planes by measuring the time a block takes to slide down each plane. The player wins the game by correctly identifying which of the two inclined planes has more friction after conducting experiments with a block and a stopwatch. The game is lost if the player incorrectly identifies the inclined plane with more friction.\n\n### Winning the Game:\nTo win the game, the player must:\n1. Take the stopwatch and the block from the workshop.\n2. Place the block on the first inclined plane and activate the stopwatch.\n3. Wait until the block slides down to the bottom, then deactivate the stopwatch and examine it to note the time.\n4. Reset the stopwatch, take the block, and repeat the process with the second inclined plane.\n5. Compare the times recorded for each inclined plane to determine which one has more friction (implied by a longer time for the block to slide down).\n6. Focus on the inclined plane with more friction as the answer.\n\n### Losing the Game:\nThe player loses the game if they incorrectly identify the inclined plane with more friction. This could happen if the player does not correctly follow the experimental procedure or misinterprets the results of their experiments.\n\n### Earning Game Scores:\nThe game score is determined by the `calculateScore` function within the `TextGame` class. Based on the provided code, the scoring logic is as follows:\n- If the player correctly identifies the inclined plane with more friction (`self.agent_answer == self.answer`), the game is marked as won (`self.gameWon = True`), the game ends (`self.gameOver = True`), and the player earns a score of 1 (`self.score = 1`).\n- If the player incorrectly identifies the inclined plane with more friction, the game is marked as lost (`self.gameWon = False`), the game ends (`self.gameOver = True`), and the player still earns a score of 1 (`self.score = 1`). However, this seems to be an oversight in the code, as logically, the player should not earn points for an incorrect answer. The scoring logic does not differentiate between a correct and incorrect answer in terms of score awarded.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The game does not explicitly provide a mechanism for measuring the time (in terms of game ticks) it takes for the block to slide down the inclined planes. However, it is implied that the player should use the stopwatch object to measure this time.\n- The game's scoring mechanism is quite simplistic and does not account for the number of steps taken or the efficiency of the player's actions. It solely depends on the final answer provided by the player.\n- The game lacks detailed feedback on the player's actions, especially regarding the experimental results with the inclined planes and the stopwatch. This feedback would be crucial for the player to make an informed decision on which inclined plane has more friction.",
    "clean-energy": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game revolves around converting all fossil-fuel power stations in various regions to renewable energy sources while maintaining the same power capacity. The game is won when all power stations are converted to renewable energy sources without any remaining fossil-fuel power stations, and the total capacity of all power plants meets or exceeds a predefined requirement. The game is lost if these conditions are not met within the given constraints.\n\nThe `calculateScore` function in the `TextGame` class plays a crucial role in determining whether the game has been won and calculating the game score. Here's how winning or losing conditions and score calculations are determined based on the `calculateScore` function:\n\n1. **Winning Conditions:**\n   - All power stations must be converted to renewable energy sources. This is checked by iterating through all regions and ensuring none of the power plants is a fossil-fuel power station.\n   - The total capacity of all power plants, adjusted for efficiency (actual output power is efficiency times capacity), must meet or exceed a predefined requirement (`self.capacity_requirement`). This ensures that the transition to renewable energy does not compromise the power capacity.\n\n2. **Losing Conditions:**\n   - If there are any fossil-fuel power stations left unconverted by the end of the game, the player loses.\n   - If the total efficient capacity of all converted renewable power plants does not meet the required capacity, the player loses.\n\n3. **Score Calculation:**\n   - The score calculation is directly tied to the winning conditions. The player starts with a baseline score of 0.\n   - If all power stations are converted to renewable energy and the total efficient capacity meets or exceeds the required capacity, the player's score is incremented by 1, the `gameOver` flag is set to True, and the `gameWon` flag is also set to True, indicating a win.\n   - The code does not explicitly define a scoring system for partial achievements or penalize wrong actions, except for the implicit failure to win the game if the conditions are not met.\n\n4. **Gameplay Mechanics:**\n   - Players can interact with the game through actions like \"look around\" to get the state of the world or \"change region X to powerplant A\" to convert a power station in a specified region to a different type of power plant.\n   - The game evaluates the efficiency of power plants based on their compatibility with the region's resources (sun, wind, water). Incorrect matches result in low-efficiency power plants, affecting the total capacity and the game's outcome.\n\nIn summary, to win the game, players must strategically convert all fossil-fuel power stations to the appropriate renewable energy sources based on each region's resources, ensuring the total power output meets the required capacity. The game score reflects the player's success in achieving these objectives.",
    "lit-lightbulb": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won by successfully lighting up the light bulb. This involves creating a conductive circuit that connects the light bulb to the battery using wires. The game is lost if the player fails to achieve this before the game ends, although specific losing conditions are not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet.\n\nThe game score is calculated based on whether the light bulb is turned on. The `calculateScore` function in the `TextGame` class checks all objects in the game world to find an object of type `LightBulb`. If the property `on` of a `LightBulb` object is `True`, indicating that the light bulb is lit, the player's score is increased by 1, the `gameOver` flag is set to `True`, and the `gameWon` flag is also set to `True`. This means that the primary way to earn a score and win the game is by successfully lighting the light bulb.\n\nThe game involves several steps where the player can interact with objects in the game world, such as taking objects, putting them in containers, and connecting electrical objects to each other. The game's score is recalculated after each action to check if the winning condition (lighting the light bulb) has been met. The game does not specify other ways to earn or lose points, so the score is directly tied to the main objective of lighting the light bulb.\n\nIn summary, to win the game and earn a score, the player must:\n1. Take the necessary components (wires, battery, and light bulb) from the environment.\n2. Use the wires to connect the light bulb to the battery correctly, ensuring that the circuit is conductive and the light bulb is lit.\n3. Once the light bulb is lit, the game calculates the score, sets the game as won, and ends the game.",
    "dishwasher": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game revolves around the task of washing dirty dishes using a dishwasher. The game is won when all dirty dishes are cleaned, and it is lost if the player fails to clean all the dishes within the constraints of the game (though specific losing conditions aren't explicitly defined in the provided code snippet).\n\n### Winning the Game:\nTo win the game, a player must:\n1. Collect dirty dishes and place them inside the dishwasher.\n2. Add soap to the dishwasher by using a dish soap bottle.\n3. Close the dishwasher and turn it on.\n4. Wait for the dishwasher cycle to complete.\n5. Open the dishwasher to find the dishes clean.\n\n### Losing the Game:\nThe code does not explicitly define a losing condition based on the provided snippet. However, failure to clean all the dishes or incorrect handling of the game objects could lead to an inability to win.\n\n### Earning Scores:\nThe `calculateScore` function in the `TextGame` class calculates the game score based on the number of dirty dishes at the start and the current state of the dishes. Here's how scores can be earned or lost:\n- The initial score is set to the negative number of starting dirty dishes. This means if the game starts with 5 dirty dishes, the initial score is -5.\n- For every dirty dish still present in the game environment, 1 point is subtracted from the score. This means the player is penalized for any dishes that remain dirty.\n- The score increases as dirty dishes are cleaned, aiming to bring the score back to zero or positive if additional scoring mechanisms were to be implemented.\n- The game is won when the score reflects that all initially dirty dishes have been cleaned, which would be indicated by a score of 0 or positive if there were additional rewards beyond just cleaning dishes.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The game involves interacting with various objects (dishes, dishwasher, soap) and performing actions (open, close, turn on, turn off, use) to achieve the goal.\n- The game's progression is determined by the player's actions, which are interpreted and executed within the game environment, affecting the game state and score.\n- The game employs a tick system (`doWorldTick` method) to simulate the passage of time or progression of actions, such as the dishwasher cycle.\n\nThis text-based game combines elements of inventory management, puzzle-solving, and object interaction to create a simulation of completing a household chore.",
    "make-campfire": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game where the player's task is to make a fire in a fire pit, winning or losing the game, as well as how scores are earned, can be deduced from the `calculateScore` method within the `TextGame` class. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### Winning the Game:\nThe game is won when a specific condition is met:\n- A `Tree` object (which has been turned into `firewood` through the use of an `Axe`) is placed inside the `FirePit` container and is set on fire (its `isCombusting` property is `True`). This is the high-level goal of the game, as described in the task description.\n- When this condition is met, the `score` is incremented by 1, the `gameOver` flag is set to `True`, and the `gameWon` flag is also set to `True`.\n\n### Losing the Game:\nThe game is lost under a specific condition:\n- If a `Tree` object has completely combusted (its `combustionTimeRemaining` property is less than 0) and it is not inside the `FirePit` container, the game is considered lost. This represents a failure to achieve the game's objective (making a fire in the fire pit) correctly.\n- When this condition is met, the `score` is set to -1, the `gameOver` flag is set to `True`, and the `gameWon` flag is set to `False`.\n\n### Earning Scores:\n- The score system is directly tied to the game's win condition. Successfully lighting firewood (previously a `Tree` object) inside the `FirePit` results in a score increment.\n- The game does not specify other means of earning scores outside of achieving the game's main objective. Thus, the primary way to earn a score is by successfully completing the game's task.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The game does not provide incremental scores for intermediate steps (e.g., chopping the tree, placing the wood in the fire pit). The scoring is binary based on the game's win/lose condition.\n- The game's mechanics involve manipulating objects within the game world (taking, putting, using items) and observing the effects of these actions. The player interacts with the game through text commands, and the game responds with descriptions of the current state or the outcome of actions.\n- The game's difficulty or complexity is not directly tied to the scoring but rather to the player's ability to deduce the correct sequence of actions from the available commands and objects within the game world.\n\nIn summary, winning the game involves successfully lighting firewood in the fire pit, which earns the player a positive score and sets the `gameWon` flag to `True`. Failing to achieve this objective, especially by allowing the tree to combust outside of the fire pit, results in losing the game, with a score set to -1.",
    "boil-water": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won by boiling water, which is achieved when there is steam in the environment. The game is designed around a kitchen setting where the player interacts with various objects such as a stove, pot, sink, and water to accomplish the task of boiling water. The game's objects and their interactions are modeled through classes that inherit from abstract classes like `GameObject`, `Container`, and `Device`.\n\n### Winning the Game\nTo win the game, the player must follow a series of steps that simulate boiling water:\n1. Take a pot and put it in the sink.\n2. Turn on the sink to fill the pot with water.\n3. Take the pot with water and put it on the stove.\n4. Turn on the stove and wait until the water boils and turns into steam.\n\n### Losing the Game\nThe game does not explicitly define a losing condition in the provided code. However, failing to complete the task of boiling water within the game's mechanics or not achieving the creation of steam would result in not winning the game.\n\n### Earning Game Scores\nThe game score is calculated based on the presence of steam in the environment, as indicated by the `calculateScore` function within the `TextGame` class. If there is any steam present in the environment, the score is set to 1, the `gameOver` flag is set to `True`, and the `gameWon` flag is also set to `True`. This implies that the game's scoring system is binary, based on the successful completion of the task (boiling water to produce steam).\n\n```python\n# Calculate the game score\ndef calculateScore(self):\n    # Baseline score\n    self.score = 0\n\n    # If there is any steam in the environment, then add a point.\n    allObjects = self.rootObject.getAllContainedObjectsRecursive()\n    for obj in allObjects:\n        if (obj.name == \"steam\"):\n            self.score = 1\n            self.gameOver = True\n            self.gameWon = True\n```\n\nIn summary, the game is won by successfully boiling water to produce steam, and the score is earned based on the successful completion of this task.

    "conductivity": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won or lost based on the player's ability to correctly determine whether a fork is conductive and then place it in the correct box (red or black) accordingly. The game simulates an experiment testing the conductivity of a fork by incorporating it into an electrical circuit with a battery and a light bulb. The player's task is to connect these components using wires and observe whether the light bulb turns on, indicating the fork's conductivity.\n\n### Winning the Game:\nThe game is won if the player correctly identifies the fork's conductivity and places it in the correct box:\n- If the fork is conductive (the light bulb turns on when the circuit is completed), the fork should be placed in the red box.\n- If the fork is not conductive (the light bulb remains off), the fork should be placed in the black box.\n\n### Losing the Game:\nThe game is lost if the player incorrectly identifies the fork's conductivity and places it in the wrong box:\n- If the fork is conductive but is placed in the black box.\n- If the fork is not conductive but is placed in the red box.\n\n### Earning Game Scores:\nThe game score is calculated based on the player's actions related to the task of testing the fork's conductivity and placing it in the correct box. The `calculateScore` function in the `TextGame` class handles the scoring logic:\n- The player earns a score of `1` if the fork is placed in the correct box based on its conductivity. This also sets the `gameOver` flag to `True` and the `gameWon` flag to `True`, indicating that the player has won the game.\n- The player earns a score of `0` if the fork is placed in the incorrect box. This also results in the game ending (`gameOver` is set to `True`), but with the `gameWon` flag set to `False`, indicating that the player has lost the game.\n\nThe game does not specify other ways to earn or lose points, so the primary focus for scoring is on correctly identifying the fork's conductivity and placing it in the appropriate box. The game encourages players to interact with the environment by looking around, taking and putting objects, and connecting electrical components to form a circuit, with the ultimate goal of testing the fork's conductivity.",
    "mix-paint": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game revolves around mixing different colors of paint to achieve a target color in an art studio environment. The game can be won by successfully mixing the correct source paints in a cup to create the target color specified at the beginning of the game. The game is lost if the player fails to create the target color, although the code does not specify conditions for losing beyond not achieving the target color within the player's actions.\n\nThe `calculateScore` function in the `TextGame` class is responsible for determining the game score and whether the game has been won. The score calculation is based on whether the target color paint exists within the game world. If an object with the property \"color\" matching the target color is found among all objects in the game world, the score is increased by 1, the `gameOver` flag is set to True, and the `gameWon` flag is also set to True. This implies that the game can be won by creating the target color paint, and doing so ends the game with a victory.\n\nThe game does not explicitly define a scoring system beyond this win condition. There are no intermediate scores or penalties mentioned for incorrect actions or steps taken by the player. The score is directly tied to the achievement of the game's primary objective, which is to mix paints to create the target color. The absence of a detailed scoring system suggests that the game's focus is on the puzzle-solving aspect of mixing colors rather than accumulating points through various actions or strategies.\n\nIn summary, to win the game, the player must:\n1. Identify the target color announced at the beginning of the game.\n2. Determine which source paints must be mixed to create the target color.\n3. Successfully mix the correct source paints in a cup to produce the target color.\n\nThe game is won when the target color paint is created, which triggers the `calculateScore` function to set the game as won and end the game. There are no intermediate scores or detailed scoring mechanics beyond achieving this primary objective.",
    "thermometer": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game revolves around the player figuring out the temperature of water in a pot within a simulated kitchen environment. The game involves interacting with objects such as a thermometer, a pot containing water, and various distractor items like different liquids in containers. The player can perform actions like looking around, examining objects, taking objects, putting objects in containers, using objects, and answering the temperature of the water.\n\n### Winning or Losing the Game:\n- **Winning Condition:** The game is won if the player correctly answers the temperature of the water in the pot. This is determined by the `calculateScore` method, which checks if the player's answer (`self.answer_temperature`) matches the actual temperature of the water (`self.water_temperature`). If the answer is correct, the player's score is increased by 1, the game is marked as over (`self.gameOver = True`), and the game is marked as won (`self.gameWon = True`).\n- **Losing Condition:** The game is lost if the player answers incorrectly. In this case, the score is set to 0, the game is marked as over (`self.gameOver = True`), and the game is marked as not won (`self.gameWon = False`).\n\n### Earning Scores:\n- The game's scoring system is straightforward. The player starts with a score of 0. The only way to earn a score is by correctly answering the temperature of the water in the pot. If the player's answer matches the actual temperature, the score is increased by 1. There are no partial scores or penalties for incorrect answers or other actions within the game; the score either remains at 0 (for incorrect answers or no answer) or goes to 1 (for a correct answer).\n\n### Key Points:\n- The game involves a simulation where the player must use a thermometer to measure the temperature of water in a pot.\n- The player interacts with the game through a set of defined actions (e.g., \"look around\", \"take thermometer\", \"use thermometer on water\", \"answer X Celsius degree\").\n- The game's outcome is binary: the player either wins by correctly answering the water's temperature or loses by answering incorrectly.\n- The scoring system is also binary: the player either earns a score of 1 by winning the game or retains a score of 0 by losing the game.\n- The game concludes once the player submits their answer regarding the water's temperature, with the game immediately evaluating the win/loss condition and the corresponding score.",
    "hang-painting": "Based on the provided Python code for a text-based game, the game can be won or lost based on specific conditions related to the task of hanging a picture on a wall. The game involves objects such as a Nail, Wall, Picture, and Hammer, and actions like looking around, managing inventory, taking or putting objects, hanging objects on a nail, and hammering a nail on a wall with a hammer.\n\n### Winning Conditions:\nThe game is won if the player successfully hammers the nail on the correct wall (the target wall chosen randomly at the start of the game) and hangs the target picture (also chosen randomly at the start) on that nail. This is determined in the `calculateScore` method, where the game checks if the nail's parent container is the target wall and if the nail contains the target picture. If these conditions are met, the game is marked as won (`self.gameWon = True`), the game is over (`self.gameOver = True`), and the score is set to 1.\n\n### Losing Conditions:\nThe game is lost if the player hammers the nail on a wrong wall (any wall other than the target wall). In this case, the game is marked as over (`self.gameOver = True`), the game is marked as not won (`self.gameWon = False`), and the score is set to 0. This check is also part of the `calculateScore` method.\n\n### Earning Scores:\nThe game score is calculated based on the actions related to the main task of hanging the target picture on the target wall. The initial score is set to 0, and the player can earn a score of 1 by completing the game's objective successfully. The `calculateScore` method adjusts the game's score, gameOver, and gameWon flags based on the current state of the game objects and their relationships (e.g., whether the nail is hammered into the target wall and whether the target picture is hanging on that nail).\n\n### Summary:\n- **Winning the Game**: Successfully hammer the nail on the target wall and hang the target picture on it.\n- **Losing the Game**: Hammer the nail on any wall other than the target wall.\n- **Scoring**: The score is binary, with 0 indicating failure to complete the task or hammering the nail on the wrong wall, and 1 indicating successful completion of the task."
