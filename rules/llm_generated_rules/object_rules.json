    "make-campfire": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable.\n- isCombustible: Determines if the object can catch fire. By default, objects are not combustible.\n- isCombusting: Indicates whether the object is currently on fire. By default, objects are not on fire.\n- combustionTimeRemaining: Represents how long (in game ticks) the object will continue to burn. By default, objects do not have a combustion time.\n\nTick Method:\n- If the object is combusting (`isCombusting` is True), the `combustionTimeRemaining` property is decreased by 1 each game tick.\n- If `combustionTimeRemaining` reaches -1, it signifies that the object has finished combusting, and `isCombusting` is set to False. This mechanism allows for objects to simulate being on fire for a certain duration, after which they stop burning.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects in the game, providing basic properties and behaviors such as containment, movability, and combustibility. The tick method specifically handles the logic for objects that are on fire, updating their state based on the passage of game time.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the gameplay by controlling access to whatever is inside the container.\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of items relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for items inside the container). This property is critical for generating accurate and understandable descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly modifies the isOpen property based on the action performed.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly modifies the isOpen property based on the action performed.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game state by changing the location of an object to inside the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is moveable and currently inside the container. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken, and a boolean flag indicating success or failure. This method affects the game state by changing the location of an object from inside the container to another location.\n\nThe Container class, by inheriting from GameObject, gains all the properties and methods of a GameObject, with additional properties and methods specific to containers. These properties and methods enable complex interactions with the container objects in the game, such as opening, closing, placing objects inside, and taking objects out, thereby enriching the gameplay experience.==========\nObject: Device\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isDevice: Indicates that this object is a device. This property is set to True, meaning every instance of this class or its subclasses is considered a device within the game context.\n- isActivatable: Determines whether the device can be turned on or off. This property is critical because it directly affects the player's ability to interact with the device in a meaningful way. By default, it is set to True, suggesting that unless specified otherwise, devices are designed to have an on/off state that can be toggled by the player.\n- isOn: Represents the current state of the device, whether it is on or off. Initially set to False, indicating that devices start in the off state. This property is crucial for gameplay mechanics involving devices, as it can affect the environment, the outcome of player actions, or interactions with other objects.\n\nMethods:\n- turnOn(): Attempts to turn the device on. It first checks if the device is activatable. If not, it returns an error message and a failure flag. If the device is already on, it returns a message indicating so and a failure flag. Otherwise, it sets the `isOn` property to True, effectively turning the device on, and returns a success message and flag. This method is essential for interacting with devices that can be activated, affecting the game state.\n- turnOff(): Similar to `turnOn()`, but for turning the device off. It checks if the device is activatable and if it is already off, returning appropriate messages and success flags. If these checks pass, it sets `isOn` to False, turning the device off, and returns a success message and flag. This method allows players to deactivate devices, potentially altering gameplay or interactions.\n- useWithObject(patientObject): Provides a template for using the device with another object (referred to as `patientObject`). By default, it returns a message indicating uncertainty about how to use the device with the specified object, along with a failure flag. This method can be overridden in subclasses to implement specific interactions between devices and other objects.\n- makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False): Generates a human-readable description of the device, including its name and whether it is currently on or off. This method enhances the game's narrative by providing players with information about the state of devices in the environment.\n\nThe `Device` class is designed to be a base class for all activatable devices within the game, providing common properties and methods for interaction. Its methods for turning on/off and using with other objects are particularly important for creating interactive and dynamic game environments.==========\nObject: Fire Pit\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isOpenable: This property indicates that a fire pit is always open, meaning it cannot be closed or locked. This is logical for a fire pit, as they are typically open structures designed for holding fire.\n- isMoveable: This property is set to False, suggesting that the fire pit cannot be moved. This makes sense as fire pits are often permanent or semi-permanent fixtures in a location, built to contain fire safely in one spot.\n- containerPrefix: The value \"in\" for this property specifies how objects contained within the fire pit are described in relation to it. For example, if the fire pit contains logs, the description would logically state that the logs are \"in\" the fire pit, reflecting the physical reality of how objects are placed within it.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the fire pit, dynamically adjusting the description based on whether it contains any items. If the fire pit contains items, it lists them, using the appropriate language to indicate that these items are \"in\" the fire pit. If it contains no items, it simply states that the fire pit is empty. This method allows for a detailed and accurate description of the fire pit's current state, which can enhance the immersion and interactivity of the text game by providing players with clear, context-sensitive information about their surroundings or the objects they interact with.==========\nObject: Match\nInherits: Device\nProperties:\n- isActivatable: Indicates whether the match can be activated or not. In this case, it is set to False, meaning the match cannot be activated in the usual way devices are in the game. This property likely reflects the single-use nature of a match; it is used directly with another object rather than being \"activated\".\n\nBehavior:\n- The `useWithObject` method defines how the match interacts with other objects in the game. This method attempts to use the match on a \"patient object\" (another object in the game). The method first removes the match from the game, reflecting its single-use nature. Then, it checks several conditions regarding the patient object:\n    1. If the patient object is not combustible (`isCombustible` is False), the match is used up without any effect, and the method returns a message indicating failure.\n    2. If the patient object is already combusting (`isCombusting` is True), the match is again used up without any effect, and a similar failure message is returned.\n    3. If the patient object has already combusted (`combustionTimeRemaining` is less than 0), the match is used up without effect, indicating the object has already been burned or combusted in the past.\n    4. If none of the above conditions are met, the method concludes that the patient object is combustible and not currently on fire or already combusted. The match is then used to set the patient object on fire (`isCombusting` is set to True), and a success message is returned.\n\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple description of the match, which is just \"a match\" in this case. This method might be used to generate text descriptions of the match when players examine it or when it is listed in inventory or game descriptions.\n\nIn summary, the Match class represents a single-use item in the game that can be used to attempt to ignite combustible objects. Its critical behavior is encapsulated in the `useWithObject` method, which handles the logic for attempting to light another object on fire, considering various states of the target object.==========\nObject: Axe\nInherits: Device\nProperties:\n- isCombustible: Indicates that the axe, or at least its handle, is capable of burning. This property is set to True, meaning the axe can catch fire.\n- combustionTimeRemaining: Represents the duration (in game ticks) that the axe will continue to burn once ignited. Initially set to 5, indicating that once the axe starts burning, it will continue to do so for 5 ticks.\n\nThe `Axe` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there's no automatic change in its properties at each game tick described in the provided code. However, the properties related to combustion suggest that if there were a tick method or another mechanism to decrease the `combustionTimeRemaining`, the axe would eventually become unusable after burning for the specified duration.\n\nThe `useWithObject` method provides functionality for using the axe with another object in the game, referred to as the \"patient object\". This method checks several conditions before the axe can be used:\n1. **If the axe is on fire** (`isCombusting` is True), it cannot be used, and the method returns a message indicating the axe is on fire along with a success flag set to False.\n2. **If the axe has been completely burned** (indicated by `combustionTimeRemaining` being less than 0), it cannot be used, and the method returns a message stating the axe no longer has a handle, with the success flag set to False.\n3. **If the patient object is choppable** (has a property `isChoppable` set to True), the axe's `useWithObject` method attempts to call the `chop` method on the patient object. If successful, it returns a message indicating the action performed and sets the success flag to True.\n4. If none of the above conditions are met, the method returns a message indicating uncertainty about how to use the axe on the patient object, with the success flag set to False.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the axe. If the axe is currently on fire (`isCombusting` is True), the description includes that it is on fire. If the axe has been completely burned (`combustionTimeRemaining` is less than 0), the description states that it has combusted. This method provides a dynamic description based on the axe's current state.==========\nObject: Tree\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- isMoveable: Indicates that the tree is too heavy to move, making it a stationary object within the game environment.\n- isCombustible: This property signifies that the tree can catch fire and will burn. This aspect introduces an element of environmental interaction or hazard.\n- combustionTimeRemaining: Reflects the duration (in game ticks) that the tree will continue to burn once ignited. Initially set to 5, this suggests that once the tree catches fire, it will remain in a burning state for 5 ticks.\n- isChoppable: A critical gameplay mechanic, indicating that the tree can be chopped down. This property likely interacts with player actions or tools, allowing for resource gathering or environmental manipulation.\n\nMethods:\n- chop(): This method simulates the action of chopping the tree. On the first call, it changes the tree's name to \"chopped down tree,\" indicating its altered state. On a subsequent call, it further modifies the tree's state to \"firewood,\" changing its prefix to \"some,\" making it movable, and marking it as no longer choppable. This method reflects a progression of states from an intact tree to a resource (firewood) that players can presumably use or transport.\n- makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False): Generates a descriptive string for the tree, incorporating its current state (e.g., intact, chopped down, or turned into firewood) and whether it is on fire or has combusted. This method enhances the game's narrative and environmental description by dynamically reflecting the tree's condition and interactions with other game elements (like fire).\n\nThe `Tree` class, through its properties and methods, introduces gameplay elements of resource management (chopping for wood), environmental interaction (combustibility), and dynamic object states (from tree to firewood). These aspects contribute to a richer, more interactive game world.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties: None specified as critical within the `__init__` method.\n\nThe `World` class does not explicitly define any properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `Container` class. It is designed to represent a \"world\" within the game, with the initial setting being a \"forest\". This class does not have a `tick` method, so there's no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a way to generate a descriptive string about the world, specifically mentioning that the player finds themselves in a forest and listing all objects contained within this world. Each object's description is obtained by calling its `makeDescriptionStr` method, which suggests that objects within the world can have their detailed descriptions. This method supports both a simple and a detailed description mode, although the detailed mode's behavior is dependent on the contained objects' implementation of `makeDescriptionStr`.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no specific critical properties to discuss. However, it's worth noting the unique aspects of this class as follows:\n\n1. **Identity and Referents**: The `Agent` class represents an agent within the game, likely the player or an NPC (Non-Player Character). The method `getReferents` returns `[\"yourself\"]`, indicating that this object refers to the player or an NPC in a self-referential manner. This could be used in text parsing or generating descriptions that involve the agent directly.\n\n2. **Description Generation**: The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns `\"yourself\"`. This suggests that whenever the game needs to describe this object, it will refer to it in a manner that is directly addressing the player or character as \"yourself\". This is a simple approach and might be part of a larger system where the context of the agent is understood to be the player or a specific NPC.\n\n- **Tick Method**: The provided class definition does not include a `tick` method. Therefore, there's no behavior defined for how the object's properties might change over time or in response to game events. This means the `Agent` class, as defined, is static in terms of properties unless modified by external functions or methods not shown in the provided code snippet.\n\nIn summary, the `Agent` class is designed to represent a player or NPC in the game, with minimal properties and methods focused on self-identification and description. Without a `tick` method or explicit critical properties defined, the class serves as a basic container for items or attributes that might be associated with the agent in the game environment.==========\n",
    "volume": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting they can be relocated within the game environment unless this property is altered.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic attributes and methods that are common across various types of objects. It includes mechanisms for handling unique identifiers (UUIDs), naming, containment relationships (both holding other objects and being contained within another object), and property management.\n\nCritical methods include:\n- `getProperty`: Safely retrieves a property value of the object, returning `None` if the property does not exist. This method ensures that attempts to access undefined properties do not result in errors.\n- `addObject` and `removeObject`: These methods manage the containment relationship from the perspective of the container, allowing objects to be added to or removed from it.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer`: Allows an object to remove itself from its parent container, adjusting the containment hierarchy accordingly.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive`: Recursively retrieves all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects. This is useful for operations that need to consider every object within a container, no matter the depth.\n- `containsItemWithName`: Searches for objects by name directly contained within this object (non-recursively), returning a list of found objects.\n- `tick`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden in subclasses, where it can be used to implement behavior that occurs at each game tick, such as updating object states or triggering events.\n- `getReferents`: Returns a list of names or identifiers by which the object can be referred, starting with its own name.\n- `makeDescriptionStr`: Generates a human-readable description of the object, which can be detailed or brief depending on the argument passed.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not directly implement changes in object properties at each game tick since its `tick` method is empty. This behavior is intended to be defined in subclasses that override the `tick` method to specify how an object's properties or state should change over time within the game.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container, which means it can hold other objects. This is a critical property as it defines the object's ability to contain other items within the game world.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the contents within the container. If a container is closed and isOpenable, players must open it first to access or place items inside.\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of items relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for items inside the container). This is a critical property as it influences how the game describes where objects are located in relation to the container.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the isOpen property based on the conditions met.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the isOpen property based on the conditions met.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object to inside the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently inside the container. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken, and a boolean flag indicating success or failure. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object from inside the container to another location.\n- makeDescriptionStr: Generates a human-readable string that describes the container, optionally providing detailed information about its contents. This method is important for providing players with descriptions of objects within the game world.==========\nObject: Box\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nsize: a dictionary containing the dimensions of the box, including its length, width, and height.\n\nThe `Box` class inherits from `GameObject`, indicating that it is a type of object within the game world. The critical property defined in the `Box` class is `size`, which is a dictionary that stores the dimensions of the box, including its length (`l`), width (`w`), and height (`h`). These dimensions are critical for understanding the physical space the box occupies within the game, which could affect how it interacts with other objects, such as whether it can fit inside other containers or if certain items can be stored within it.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple string representation of the box, which includes its name. This method can be used to generate descriptions of the box for display to the player, helping to integrate the object into the narrative or descriptions of the game environment. However, this method does not provide detailed information about the box's size or contents, focusing instead on a basic identification.==========\nObject: Ruler\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject`. However, it introduces functionality to interact with other objects in the game, specifically for measuring.\n\nFunctionality:\n- The `useWithObject` method allows the Ruler object to interact with another object, intended to measure its dimensions. This method checks if the object to be measured is of type `Box` and if the specified edge to be measured is a valid dimension of the box. If the conditions are met, it returns the length of the specified edge of the box in centimeters. This functionality implies that the Ruler object can be used to obtain specific measurements of objects that have size properties, enhancing the game's interactivity and realism.\n\n- The method provides feedback if the object is not a `Box` or if the specified edge is not recognized, indicating the game's interactive error handling and guidance to the player.\n\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method returns a simple string description of the Ruler object, which can be used to represent the object textually within the game environment. This method supports both a simple and a detailed description, although the detailed description does not alter the output for this class.\n\nIn summary, the Ruler class is designed to add a specific interactive capability within the game, allowing players to measure objects that are defined as having dimensions. This functionality could be critical in puzzles or tasks within the game that require understanding the size of various objects.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties: None specified directly in the `__init__` method.\n\nExplanation:\nThe `World` class is designed to represent a room or environment within a text-based game. It inherits from the `Container` class, which suggests that it can hold other objects, similar to how a room can contain items or other entities. The critical functionality of the `World` class is derived from its parent class, `Container`, which allows it to maintain a list of objects (`self.contains`) that are present within the world (or room, in this context).\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the world and its contents. When called, it starts with a base description indicating that the player finds themselves in a room. It then iterates over all objects contained within the world (`self.contains`) and appends their descriptions to the output string. This method supports creating a detailed narrative of the environment, enhancing the immersive experience for the player by listing all visible items or entities in the room.\n\nThere are no properties directly defined or commented as critical within the `__init__` method of the `World` class. Therefore, the critical properties to understand the behavior of the `World` object are inherited from the `Container` class, which primarily deals with the ability to contain and manage other objects. The class does not contain a `tick` method, so there's no behavior described that changes the properties of the world or its contents over time in response to game ticks.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, there are no specific critical properties to explain based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class is designed to represent an agent (e.g., a player character or an NPC) within the game. It inherits from the `Container` class, which suggests that the agent can hold or contain other objects, similar to how a player might carry items in an inventory.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this method is used to refer to the agent object within the game's narrative or command parsing context. This could be useful for commands or descriptions that involve the player directly.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is likely used to generate a textual description of the agent object. The `makeDetailed` parameter is available but not used in the provided implementation, suggesting that there could be a more detailed description option that is either not implemented or handled elsewhere.\n\nTick Method:\n- There is no `tick` method defined in the provided class definition, so there is no behavior to describe regarding how the object's properties might change at each game tick.==========\n",
    "boil-water": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, allowing them to be transported or relocated within the game environment.\n- temperature: Sets the initial temperature of the object to 20 degrees Celsius. This property suggests that the game may simulate temperature effects or require temperature management for certain objects or scenarios.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not inherit from any other classes, making it a foundational element in the game's object hierarchy. It is designed to be extended by other classes that represent specific objects within the game. The critical properties defined in the `__init__` method establish basic characteristics that can be expected for any object within the game, such as its ability to be moved, to contain other objects, and to have a temperature.\n\nThe class also includes several methods for managing object properties and relationships with other objects:\n- `getProperty`: Safely retrieves a property value, returning `None` if the property does not exist. This method ensures that attempts to access undefined properties do not result in errors.\n- `addObject` and `removeObject`: These methods manage the containment relationship between objects, allowing objects to be added to or removed from this object's `contains` list, effectively making it a container if it holds other objects.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer`: Allows an object to remove itself from its parent container, if it has one, maintaining the integrity of the containment hierarchy.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive` and `containsItemWithName`: These methods facilitate the retrieval of contained objects, either by recursively gathering all objects within this object or by finding objects with a specific name directly contained by this object.\n- `tick`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden by subclasses to implement behavior that occurs at each game tick, such as updating object properties or triggering events.\n- `getReferents`: Returns a list of names by which the object can be identified, initially just the object's name and ID.\n- `makeDescriptionStr`: Generates a human-readable description of the object, which can be detailed or brief depending on the `makeDetailed` parameter.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a versatile base for creating a wide range of objects within the game, providing essential properties and behaviors that can be customized or extended by subclasses to create a rich and interactive game world.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the container's contents. If a container is closed, players may not be able to place objects in it or take objects from it without first opening the container.\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods and Their Impact on Properties:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method directly affects the 'isOpen' property by setting it to True if the container is successfully opened, thereby changing how players can interact with the container and its contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This method directly affects the 'isOpen' property by setting it to False if the container is successfully closed, impacting the accessibility of the container's contents.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Attempts to place an object inside the container if the container is a container, is open, and the object is moveable. This method impacts the game state by potentially adding objects to the container's contents, affecting the gameplay by allowing players to organize or store objects.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is a container, is open, and the object is moveable and contained within. This method impacts the game state by potentially removing objects from the container's contents, affecting the gameplay by allowing players to retrieve stored or hidden objects.\n\nOverall, the Container class defines an object that can hold other objects, with properties and methods that govern how objects can be added to or removed from it, based on its open/closed state and whether it is openable. These interactions are crucial for gameplay mechanics involving inventory management, puzzle-solving, or exploration.==========\nObject: Device\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isDevice: Indicates that the object is a device. This property is set to True, meaning every instance of this class or its subclasses is considered a device within the game context.\n- isActivatable: Determines whether the device can be turned on or off. This property is critical because it directly affects the player's ability to interact with the device in a meaningful way, such as turning a light on to illuminate a room or starting a machine to perform a task. It is set to True, suggesting that, by default, devices are designed to be interactable in this manner.\n- isOn: Tracks the current state of the device, whether it is on or off. This property is crucial for gameplay dynamics as it influences the outcome of player interactions with the device. For example, a device that is off might need to be turned on to achieve a certain objective. It is initially set to False, indicating that devices start in the off state.\n\nMethods:\n- turnOn(): Attempts to turn the device on. This method checks if the device is activatable and not already on. If these conditions are met, it sets `isOn` to True and returns a success message and flag. This method is significant because it provides a way for players to interact with devices, changing their state to \"on\" and potentially affecting the game environment or progress.\n- turnOff(): Attempts to turn the device off. Similar to `turnOn()`, this method checks if the device is activatable and currently on. If so, it sets `isOn` to False and returns a success message and flag. This allows players to deactivate devices, which could be necessary for solving puzzles or preventing unwanted effects within the game.\n- useWithObject(patientObject): Provides a template for interacting with another object in the game, though by default, it does not specify how the interaction occurs and returns a message indicating uncertainty. This method suggests a framework for extending device functionality, where specific devices could override this method to allow for meaningful interactions with other objects, such as using a key device with a lock.\n- makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False): Generates a human-readable description of the device, indicating its name and whether it is currently on or off. This method enhances the game's narrative and user interface by providing players with information about the state of devices they encounter, which can inform their decisions and strategies.\n\nOverall, the Device class provides a foundational structure for creating interactive objects within the game that can be turned on or off, potentially affecting the game environment or the player's ability to progress. It emphasizes interactivity and the impact of player actions on the game world.==========\nObject: Stove\nInherits: Container, Device\n\nProperties:\n- **isOpenable**: Indicates that the stove cannot be opened. This property is critical because it defines the interaction limitations with the stove. Players cannot open it to place or retrieve items directly inside it, which is typical for a stove's functionality in a game setting.\n- **isMoveable**: Signifies that the stove is too heavy to be moved. This property is essential as it sets the stove as a static object within the game environment. It implies that the player's interaction with the stove is limited to its fixed location, enhancing realism in the game's world.\n- **maxTemperature**: The maximum temperature the stove can reach, set at 500 degrees Celsius. This property is crucial for gameplay mechanics involving cooking or heating items. It defines the limit to how much an object's temperature can be increased, affecting how items are processed or transformed when placed on the stove.\n- **tempIncreasePerTick**: Specifies how much the temperature increases per game tick for objects on the stove, provided the stove is on. Set at 25 degrees Celsius per tick, this property is vital for determining the rate at which items on the stove heat up. It impacts game dynamics by controlling the speed of cooking or heating processes, requiring players to manage time effectively.\n\nTick Method Functionality:\n- The `tick` method increases the temperature of any objects placed on the stove by 25 degrees Celsius per tick, but only if the stove is turned on (`isOn` == True). This method iterates through all objects on the stove, applying the temperature increase to each. If an object's new temperature would exceed the stove's maximum temperature (500 degrees Celsius), it is capped at this maximum value. This functionality is critical for simulating realistic cooking or heating processes, where items gradually heat up to a point and require monitoring to prevent overheating or burning.==========\nObject: Pot\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isOpenable: Indicates that a pot cannot be opened. This property is critical because it defines the interaction capabilities with the pot. Since it is set to False, it means players or other objects cannot open the pot to access its contents in the same way they might open a door or a chest. This property affects how the pot is used within the game, emphasizing its role as a container that doesn't offer the typical open/close functionality.\n\nThe `Pot` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no properties that change at each game tick to describe.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a dynamic description of the pot based on its contents. If the pot contains other objects, it lists those objects, using the phrase \"that looks to have\" followed by the names of the contained objects and the preposition \"in\" to indicate their location inside the pot. If the pot is empty, the description simply states \"that is empty.\" This method enhances the interactive and immersive experience by giving players detailed feedback about the state of the pot and its contents.==========\nObject: Substance\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- solidName: The name of the substance when it is in its solid state.\n- liquidName: The name of the substance when it is in its liquid state.\n- gasName: The name of the substance when it is in its gaseous state.\n- boilingPoint: The temperature at which the substance transitions from a liquid to a gas.\n- meltingPoint: The temperature at which the substance transitions from a solid to a liquid.\n- temperature: The current temperature of the substance in degrees Celsius.\n\nThe `Substance` class represents a substance that can exist in different states of matter (solid, liquid, gas) depending on its temperature. The class inherits from `GameObject`, indicating it is an object within the game world with a name and potentially other properties managed by the `GameObject` superclass.\n\nThe critical properties set in the `__init__` method define the substance's characteristics, including its names in different states, its boiling and melting points, and its current temperature. These properties are essential for determining the substance's state of matter at any given time.\n\nThe `tick` method is responsible for updating the substance's state of matter based on its current temperature. It checks the substance's temperature against its melting and boiling points to determine if it should be a solid, liquid, or gas. The substance's name is then updated to reflect its current state of matter. This dynamic change in state and name allows for a more interactive and realistic simulation of substances within the game environment.\n\nFor example, if a substance with a melting point of 0°C and a boiling point of 100°C has its temperature set to 50°C, it would be considered a liquid during the game's tick, and its name would be updated to its `liquidName`. If the temperature were then increased above 100°C in a subsequent tick, the substance would become a gas, and its name would change to its `gasName`.\n\nThis behavior allows the game to simulate physical changes in substances, adding depth and realism to the game world.==========\nObject: Water\nInherits: Substance\n\nProperties:\n- stateOfMatter: the current state of the water (ice, water, or steam), which is determined by its temperature.\n- freezingPoint: the temperature at which the water freezes (0 degrees Celsius for water).\n- boilingPoint: the temperature at which the water boils (100 degrees Celsius for water).\n- temperature: the current temperature of the water, which affects its state of matter.\n\nThe `Water` class inherits from the `Substance` class and is initialized with specific parameters to represent water. These parameters include the names for its different states of matter (\"ice\" for solid, \"water\" for liquid, and \"steam\" for gas), its boiling point (100 degrees Celsius), its freezing point (0 degrees Celsius), and a starting temperature of 20 degrees Celsius. Upon initialization, the `tick` method is called to set the initial state of matter based on the starting temperature.\n\nThe `tick` method, inherited from the `Substance` class and not explicitly defined in the `Water` class, likely checks the current temperature of the water against its freezing and boiling points to update the `stateOfMatter` property accordingly. If the temperature is below the freezing point, the state of matter would be set to \"ice\". If the temperature is above the boiling point, the state would be \"steam\". Otherwise, the state remains as \"water\". This method ensures that the water's state of matter is accurately represented based on its current temperature, which can change during the game.==========\nObject: Sink\nInherits: Container, Device\n\nProperties:\n- containerPrefix: Indicates the preposition used to describe where objects are in relation to the sink, which is \"in\" in this case. This means when describing objects within the sink, the description will use \"in\" (e.g., \"in the sink\").\n- isOpenable: This property is set to False, indicating that a sink cannot be opened or closed like some other containers or devices might be. This is typical for a sink, as they do not have a lid or door mechanism.\n- isMoveable: This property is also set to False, suggesting that the sink is a fixed object within the game environment. It cannot be moved by the player or by other objects within the game.\n\nTick Method Functionality:\n- On each game tick, if the sink is turned on (`isOn` property is True), the tick method will add water to any object within the sink that does not already have water on it. This is achieved by iterating through all objects contained within the sink. If an object is a container and does not contain an instance of `Water`, a new `Water` object is added to it. This simulates filling containers with water when the sink is turned on.\n- The process involves checking each object within the sink to see if it is a container (`isinstance(obj, Container)`). If it is, the method then checks if any of the objects inside the container is of type `Water`. If not, it proceeds to add a `Water` object to the container, effectively simulating the action of filling the container with water.\n\nThis functionality implies that the sink can interact with other objects in a dynamic way, affecting their state based on whether the sink is turned on or off. It also suggests that the game includes a mechanism for objects to contain other objects (as seen with the `Container` class) and for specific types of objects to exist within the game world (like `Water`).==========\nObject: Food\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nisFood: Indicates that the object is food, which is a critical property for interactions within the game that involve eating or cooking.\n\nThe `Food` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior described that changes the object properties at each game tick. The critical property set in the `__init__` method is `isFood`, which is set to `True`. This property likely allows the game to recognize `Food` objects as consumable or interactable in a context related to food, such as cooking or eating. The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple description of the food item, which includes its name, making it easier for players to identify the food item within the game.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a \"world\" or environment within the game, with the initial example being a kitchen. The critical aspect of this class lies in its ability to contain other objects, as indicated by its inheritance from the Container class.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the world, specifically detailing what objects are contained within it. When called, it constructs a string that begins with a general description (\"You find yourself in a kitchen. In the kitchen, you see: \") followed by a list of descriptions for each object contained within the world. If the `makeDetailed` flag is set to `True`, the descriptions of the contained objects could potentially be more detailed, depending on their own `makeDescriptionStr` implementations. However, this class does not modify any properties over time or in response to game ticks, as it lacks a `tick` method.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `GameObject` and `Container` classes. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no specific critical properties to discuss. However, it's worth noting the unique aspects of this class as they relate to its role in the game.\n\nThe `Agent` class represents an entity in the game that can contain other objects, as indicated by its inheritance from the `Container` class. This suggests that the agent can carry or hold items, which is a common feature for player characters or NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in text-based games.\n\nThe `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, which implies that this class is intended to represent the player or an NPC from a first-person perspective. This method could be used in the game's text parsing system to recognize references to the player or the NPC when interpreting player input or generating descriptions.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is likely used to generate a text description of the agent within the game. The lack of detail or differentiation in the description suggests that this class might be a base class for more specific types of agents (e.g., player characters, NPCs with distinct roles or identities) where more detailed descriptions would be implemented.\n\nThere is no `tick` method defined in this class, which means there are no properties that change at each game tick directly within this class. However, inheriting from `Container` suggests that the agent's inventory or the items it holds could be interacted with or affected by the game's mechanics in other ways not directly shown in this snippet.==========\n",
    "hang-painting": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, which means they cannot hold other objects unless this property is set to True.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, allowing them to be taken or placed in different locations by the player or game mechanics.\n- isUsable: Determines if the object can be used for an action or purpose within the game. By default, objects are not usable, meaning they don't have a specific function unless this property is explicitly set.\n- isActivatable: Defines whether the object can be activated or turned on/off. By default, objects are not activatable, indicating they don't have an active state that affects the game environment unless otherwise specified.\n- temperature: Sets the initial temperature of the object to 20 degrees Celsius. This property suggests that the game may simulate temperature effects or require temperature management for certain objects or environments.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not directly inherit from any other classes, making it a foundational class in the game's object hierarchy. It is designed to be extended by other classes that represent specific objects within the game world. The critical properties defined in the `__init__` method establish basic characteristics that can be applied to a wide range of game objects, such as whether they can be moved, used, or contain other objects. These properties are essential for determining how objects interact with the player and the game environment.\n\nThe class also includes methods for managing contained objects (adding, removing, and querying them), which supports the composition of objects (e.g., a box containing a key). The `tick` method is defined but does not perform any actions, allowing derived classes to override it with specific behavior that occurs at each game tick, such as changing properties over time or reacting to game events. The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a basic mechanism for generating a textual description of the object, which can be enhanced in derived classes to offer more detailed or context-specific information.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- **isContainer**: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, which is fundamental to its role in the game.\n- **isOpenable**: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container. If a container is not openable, it means its contents are always accessible (or inaccessible if it cannot be opened due to being permanently closed), affecting gameplay and puzzle mechanics.\n- **isOpen**: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property because the accessibility of the container's contents depends on this state. If the container is closed, players may need to find a way to open it to access its contents.\n- **containerPrefix**: This property is used to describe how objects are situated in relation to the container (e.g., \"in the box\", \"on the table\"). It's critical for generating descriptive text that accurately reflects the spatial relationship between the container and its contents, enhancing the game's narrative and immersion.\n\nMethods:\n- **openContainer()**: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method directly manipulates the `isOpen` property based on the container's state, affecting how players can interact with the container and its contents.\n- **closeContainer()**: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. Similar to `openContainer()`, this method changes the `isOpen` property, which can restrict or allow access to the container's contents.\n- **placeObjectInContainer(obj)**: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object, potentially solving puzzles or affecting gameplay.\n- **takeObjectFromContainer(obj)**: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is contained within it and is moveable. This method is critical for gameplay, as it allows players to retrieve items that may be necessary for puzzle-solving or progression.\n- **makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False)**: Generates a human-readable description of the container and, optionally, detailed descriptions of its contents. This method is essential for providing players with the information needed to understand their surroundings and make informed decisions about how to interact with the game world.==========\nObject: Nail\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- The class does not explicitly define critical properties within the `__init__` method through comments as the example provided does. However, based on the functionality provided by the methods, we can infer some implicit properties and behaviors critical to understanding the Nail object's role in the game.\n\n1. **Capability to Hang Pictures**: The `hang` method allows the Nail object to associate with a Picture object, provided the Nail is hammered into a Wall (implied by checking `self.parentContainer` is a Wall). This suggests that the Nail object has a property or behavior that enables it to act as a hanging point for Picture objects within the game environment.\n\n2. **Single-Item Container**: Although the Nail class inherits from Container, the `hang` method implies a restriction that it can only contain one item at a time. Attempting to hang another Picture when one is already present results in a failure message. This indicates a critical behavior of the Nail object as a single-item container.\n\n3. **Dependency on Parent Container**: The ability to hang a Picture on the Nail is contingent upon the Nail being hammered into a Wall. This dependency on the Nail's `parentContainer` being a Wall is a critical aspect of its functionality, as it restricts where the Nail can be effectively used within the game.\n\n4. **Type-Specific Functionality**: The `hang` method checks the type of the object being hung to ensure it is a Picture. This type-specific functionality is critical as it prevents the Nail from being used to hang objects that are not Pictures, enforcing a form of type safety within the game's logic.\n\n5. **Error Handling and Feedback**: The `hang` method provides explicit feedback for various failure conditions (e.g., attempting to hang a non-Picture object, trying to hang a Picture when the Nail is not on a Wall, or trying to hang a Picture on a Nail that already has one). This feedback mechanism is critical for guiding player interactions with the Nail object.\n\n6. **Descriptive Text Generation**: The `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a description of the Nail object, which changes based on whether a Picture is hung on it. This dynamic description generation is a critical property for providing visual feedback to the player about the state of the Nail within the game world.\n\nThe Nail class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.==========\nObject: Wall\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isMoveable: Indicates that the wall cannot be moved. This property is critical because it defines the wall's immobility within the game environment, suggesting that the wall is a fixed structure.\n\nMethods:\n- placeObjectInContainer: Overrides the Container class method to prevent any object from being placed on the wall, reflecting the game's logic that walls cannot hold items in the same way as shelves or tables might.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Overrides the Container class method to prevent objects (specifically mentioned as nails in the context) from being removed by the agent, reinforcing the idea that once something is attached to the wall, it cannot be easily taken off by the player.\n- hammer: Allows for a specific type of object (a Nail) to be added to the wall's contents. This method introduces an interaction specific to the Wall object, where nails can be hammered into it, possibly for the purpose of hanging other items.\n- makeDescriptionStr: Provides a description of the wall, which changes based on whether it contains any items. If the wall has items (in this case, specifically a nail), it describes the item hanging on it. This method is crucial for giving players feedback about the state of the wall and its contents in a text-based game environment.\n\nThe Wall class, through its properties and methods, is designed to simulate the physical limitations and possible interactions with a wall in a game setting. It emphasizes the wall's role as a non-moveable structure that can have specific items (like nails) added to it but does not allow for the general storage or removal of items.==========\nObject: Picture\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject`. The critical property inherited from `GameObject` is the `name` of the Picture, which is used to identify it and is set during the initialization of the Picture object.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple description of the Picture object, utilizing its `name` property to generate a string that describes the Picture. This method does not modify any properties but offers a way to represent the Picture object as a string, potentially for display purposes in the game. There is no `tick` method in this class, so there are no changes to properties at each game tick to describe.==========\nObject: Hammer\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject`. The critical property inherited from `GameObject` is the `name` of the hammer, which is set when an instance of the Hammer class is created. This name is used to identify the hammer within the game.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple description of the hammer, incorporating its name into the returned string. This method allows for a basic representation of the hammer object when generating text for the game, but it does not modify or rely on any additional properties beyond the name. There is no `tick` method in this class, so there are no changes to properties at each game tick to describe.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. The critical aspect of this class is its role as a container for other objects, specifically designed to represent a \"living room\" environment within the game. It inherits properties and methods from the Container class, which likely includes functionalities for adding, removing, and managing contained objects.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method in the World class is designed to provide a textual description of the living room and its contents. When called, it constructs a string that begins with a fixed introduction (\"You find yourself in a living room. In the living room, you see: \") followed by a detailed list of all objects contained within the World object. Each object's description is indented for readability, and if the `makeDescriptionStr` method of contained objects supports detailed descriptions (as indicated by the `makeDetailed` parameter), those detailed descriptions are included in the output. This method enhances the immersive experience by dynamically generating descriptions based on the current state of the game world, particularly the objects present in the living room.\n\nSince there is no `tick` method defined in the World class, there are no properties that change at each game tick within this class definition. The behavior and state of the World object and its contents over time would depend on interactions defined elsewhere in the game's codebase, such as through player actions or other object behaviors that affect the World's state.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, there are no specific critical properties to discuss based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class is designed to represent an agent within the game, likely the player or an NPC, given its method to return referents as [\"yourself\"] and its description method returning \"yourself\". This suggests the object is intended to represent entities capable of actions or interactions within the game world, with a focus on the player's perspective.\n- The class inherits from `Container`, which implies that the `Agent` can hold other objects. This is a common feature in text-based games, allowing players or NPCs to carry items.\n- The `getReferents` method indicates how the object can be referred to in the game. In this case, it returns [\"yourself\"], suggesting that the agent can be referred to in a way that is directly related to the player or the character they are controlling.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple description of the agent. When called, it merely returns \"yourself\", which is a minimalistic approach but fits the context of representing the player or an NPC in the game. This method can be overridden to provide more detailed descriptions if needed, as indicated by the `makeDetailed` parameter, although the provided code does not implement any detailed description logic.\n\nThe class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior defined for how the object's properties might change at each game tick.==========\n",
    "metal-detector": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or by other means within the game environment.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. It includes mechanisms for handling unique identification through a `uuid`, managing containment relationships (both holding other objects and being contained within another object), and basic property management (setting, getting, and checking properties).\n\nThe class also defines a `tick` method, which is meant to be overridden by subclasses that need to perform specific actions or updates at each tick of the game's clock. In its base form, the `tick` method does nothing, serving as a placeholder for game objects that remain static over time unless their behavior is explicitly defined in a subclass.\n\nAdditionally, the class provides utility methods for:\n- Safely getting properties to avoid errors when accessing non-existent properties.\n- Adding or removing objects from the container, if the object is a container.\n- Recursively listing all objects contained within, if the object is a container.\n- Finding contained objects by name, facilitating interaction and manipulation of specific objects within the game.\n- Generating a basic description of the object, which can be expanded for more detailed descriptions in subclasses.\n\nThis class is critical for establishing a common interface and set of behaviors for all objects in the game, ensuring consistency and simplifying the development of more complex objects and interactions.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the container's contents. If a container is closed, players may not be able to place or take objects from it without opening it first.\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly modifies the `isOpen` property.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly modifies the `isOpen` property.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object to inside the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is moveable and currently inside the container. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken, and a boolean flag indicating success or failure. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object from inside the container to another location (e.g., the player's inventory or another container).\n\nThe `Container` class, by inheriting from `GameObject`, gains all the properties and methods of a basic game object, with additional functionality specific to objects that can contain other objects. The critical properties and methods of the `Container` class enable complex interactions in the game, such as storing, retrieving, and manipulating objects within containers, which can add depth and realism to the game world.==========\nObject: Room\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- connects: This property is a dictionary that maps directions (north, east, south, west) to other rooms that this room connects to. It is critical for defining the navigational structure of the game, allowing players to move between connected rooms. Initially, all directions are set to None, indicating that the room does not have any connections yet. Connections can be established using the `connect` method, which not only sets the connection in one direction but also ensures that the connected room has a reciprocal connection back to this room. This bidirectional linking is essential for creating a coherent and navigable world structure in the game.\n  \n- buried: This list contains objects that are buried in the room. Initially, it is empty, but objects can be added to it using the `bury` method. This feature allows for more interactive and dynamic environments where players can discover hidden items. The `bury` method not only adds the object to the `buried` list but also to the room's general `contains` list (inherited from the Container class) and updates the `buried` property to include the name of the buried object. This dual tracking (both in the `buried` list and the `properties[\"buried\"]` list) ensures that the game can differentiate between objects that are simply in the room and those that are specifically buried, potentially requiring different interactions or tools to access.\n\nMethods:\n- bury(obj): This method allows for an object to be buried in the room. It adds the object to the room's `contains` list (inheriting this functionality from the Container class) and to the `buried` list. It also updates the `properties[\"buried\"]` list with the name of the buried object, which could be used for descriptive purposes or game logic, such as determining if a player can find or interact with buried items.\n\n- makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False): Generates a description of the room, including a list of visible objects that are not buried. This method provides a textual representation of the room and its contents, which is essential for text-based games where the narrative and descriptions drive the player's imagination and actions.\n\n- connect(room, direction): This method establishes a connection from this room to another room in a specified direction. It updates both the `connects` dictionary and the `properties[\"connects\"]` dictionary to include the new connection. Additionally, it ensures that the connected room has a reciprocal connection back to this room, creating a navigable two-way path between the rooms. This method is crucial for building the game's world, allowing for the creation of a complex map where players can explore different rooms and their connections.==========\nObject: Item\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nisMetal: indicates whether the item is made of metal or not. This could affect how the item interacts with other objects or environments in the game, such as conducting electricity or being affected by magnets.==========\nObject: Shovel\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\ndurability: the number of times the shovel can dig before it is considered broken.\n\nThe `Shovel` class inherits from the `GameObject` class, indicating that it is a type of game object within the game's world. The critical property of the `Shovel` object is its `durability`, which is defined during the initialization of the object. This property represents how many times the shovel can be used to dig before it breaks. \n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the shovel. If the shovel's durability has reached 0, indicating that it is broken, the description will reflect this by stating it is a \"broken [name of the shovel]\". Otherwise, it simply describes the shovel by its name, indicating it is still usable. This method allows for a dynamic description based on the shovel's current state, specifically its durability.==========\nObject: Metal Detector\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- There are no critical properties explicitly defined within the `__init__` method for the Metal Detector class. However, the functionality of the Metal Detector is centered around detecting metal objects within a given room.\n\nFunctionality:\n- The `detect` method allows the Metal Detector to identify if there are any metal objects within the `buried` attribute of a room. This method iterates through each object in the `buried` list of the room. If any of these objects have the property `isMetal` set to True, the Metal Detector will acknowledge finding metal by returning a message indicating that it pings. Otherwise, if no metal objects are found, it returns a message stating that nothing happens. This functionality is critical for gameplay involving the search for buried metal objects, providing a direct interaction mechanism between the player, the Metal Detector, and the environment.\n\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple description of the Metal Detector, which can be enhanced with more details if the `makeDetailed` flag is set to True. However, in its current implementation, the detailed description does not differ from the basic one. This method ensures that the Metal Detector can be described within the game's narrative or inventory system in a straightforward manner.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a \"world\" in the game, with the initial example being set to a \"beach\". The critical properties would therefore be those inherent to the Container class, such as the ability to contain other objects, but specific properties like \"isOpenable\" or \"isMoveable\" are not directly addressed in this snippet.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method is not a property but a functionality of the World object that generates a descriptive string about a room (passed as an argument) and its connections to other rooms. This method enhances the description by appending information about possible directions the player can take from the current room, based on the room's connection attributes. This method assumes that the room object has a `makeDescriptionStr` method of its own to describe the room itself and a `connects` dictionary or similar data structure that maps directions to other room objects (or `None` if there is no room in that direction).\n\nIn summary, the World class is designed to encapsulate a collection of interconnected rooms (or other spaces) in a text-based game, providing a method to describe a specific room and its immediate connections to other rooms, enhancing the navigational understanding for the player.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method as per the given instructions. However, by inheriting from `Container`, it implicitly has properties related to containing other objects, such as a list of objects it contains (`self.contains`). This suggests that the agent can carry or hold other objects within the game.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this object refers to the player or an NPC (Non-Player Character) within the game. This method could be used in the game's text parsing system to identify commands directed towards the player's character or an NPC.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This suggests that when the game needs to describe this object (likely representing the player or an NPC), it will simply refer to it as \"yourself\". This could be part of the game's narrative or text output to the player, maintaining immersion by directly addressing the player or by keeping the narrative focused on the player's perspective.\n- Since there is no `tick` method defined within this class, there are no properties that change at each game tick based on the provided code. This means the Agent's state remains constant over time unless acted upon by other game mechanics or scripts outside of what is shown.==========\n",
    "forge-key": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class and does not inherit from any other class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, which means they cannot hold other objects unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, allowing them to be taken, dropped, or moved to different locations within the game environment.\n- temperature: Sets the initial temperature of the object to 20 degrees Celsius. This property suggests that the game might simulate temperature effects or require temperature management for certain objects or environments.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing essential properties and methods that can be extended or overridden by subclasses. The class includes mechanisms for managing an object's containment within other objects, tracking its unique identifier (UUID), and handling its properties in a flexible manner. The `tick` method, which is empty in this class, is designed to be overridden by subclasses to implement behavior that occurs at each game tick, such as changes in state or automatic actions. The class also includes utility methods for safely accessing properties, adding or removing objects from containers, and generating descriptions of the object, which can be used for display purposes or interaction feedback in the game.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container, which means it can hold other objects. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other items within the game world.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the contents within the container. If a container is closed, players may not be able to access its contents without first opening it.\n- containerPrefix: This property defines the preposition used to describe the location of items relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for items inside the container). It's critical for generating accurate and contextually appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the isOpen property based on the conditions met.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the isOpen property based on the conditions met.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object to within the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is moveable and contained within. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken, and a boolean flag indicating success or failure. This method changes the game's state by removing an object from the container.\n\nThe Container class, through its properties and methods, provides a foundational mechanism for objects in the game world to hold other objects, thereby enabling complex interactions such as storing, retrieving, and manipulating items within containers. This functionality is essential for creating a dynamic and interactive game environment.==========\nObject: HeatSource\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isLiquidContainer: Indicates whether the heat source is designed to contain liquids or not. This property allows the game to determine if the heat source can be used with liquid objects, affecting gameplay and interactions.\n- maxTemperature: The maximum temperature that the heat source can reach, measured in degrees Celsius. This property sets a limit on how hot the heat source can make objects that are placed on or within it.\n- tempIncreasePerTick: Specifies how much the temperature of objects on or within the heat source increases per game tick, assuming the heat source is turned on. This rate of temperature increase is crucial for gameplay mechanics involving cooking, heating, or any process requiring temperature changes.\n- isOn: A boolean indicating whether the heat source is currently active (on) or inactive (off). This property affects whether the heat source will heat objects contained within it during each game tick.\n- isMoveable: Set to False, indicating that the heat source cannot be moved. This property could reflect the heat source's size, weight, or intended permanence in a location within the game world.\n\nTick Method:\n- If the heat source is on (`isOn` is True), it iterates through all objects contained within it. For each object, if its current temperature is already above the `maxTemperature`, the method reduces the object's temperature by `tempIncreasePerTick` but does not allow it to go below `maxTemperature`. Conversely, if the object's temperature is below `maxTemperature`, it increases the temperature by `tempIncreasePerTick` without exceeding `maxTemperature`. This nuanced approach allows for both heating and cooling effects, simulating a more realistic interaction with temperature.\n\nTurn On/Off Methods:\n- These methods allow the heat source to be turned on or off. Attempting to change the state to its current value results in an error message, while a successful change provides a confirmation. These interactions are essential for controlling when and how the heat source affects its contents and the surrounding environment.\n\nDescription Method:\n- Generates a string description of the heat source, including its name, whether it is on or off, and a list of items it contains. The description varies based on the presence of items and can provide detailed information about those items if `makeDetailed` is True. This method enhances the game's interactivity by giving players insights into the state and contents of the heat source.==========\nObject: Mold\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- mold_shape: This property defines the shape of the mold, which is critical for determining the final shape of objects that solidify within it. When a liquid object is added to the mold, its `solidShapeName` property is set to this mold shape, indicating the object will take this shape as it solidifies.\n- temperature: The starting or current temperature of the mold. This property is important for simulating the environment within the mold, affecting how quickly objects within it can change state (e.g., from liquid to solid).\n- tempIncreasePerTick: This property represents the rate of temperature change per game tick. Despite its name suggesting an increase, the code uses this value to adjust the temperature of contained objects towards the mold's temperature, either by cooling down or heating up, depending on their initial temperature relative to the mold's.\n- isLiquidContainer: A boolean property indicating that the mold can contain liquid objects. This is critical for gameplay mechanics that involve changing the state of matter of objects, such as casting materials into the mold to create solid objects of a specific shape.\n\nBehavior:\n- addObject(obj): When an object is added to the mold, if the object's state of matter is liquid, its `solidShapeName` property is set to the mold's shape. This simulates the process of filling the mold with a liquid that will eventually take the shape of the mold as it solidifies.\n- tick(): During each game tick, the temperature of all objects contained within the mold is adjusted towards the mold's temperature at a rate defined by `tempIncreasePerTick`. If an object's temperature is higher than the mold's, it cools down; if it's lower, it heats up. This simulates the thermal exchange process, important for gameplay elements involving temperature-dependent transformations, such as melting or solidification.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the mold, including its contents and their arrangement, which can be used for displaying information to the player in a text-based game interface.==========\nObject: Substance\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- solidName: The name of the substance when it is in its solid state.\n- liquidName: The name of the substance when it is in its liquid state.\n- gasName: The name of the substance when it is in its gas state.\n- solidShapeName: The shape name of the substance when it is in its solid state.\n- boilingPoint: The temperature at which the substance transitions from a liquid to a gas.\n- meltingPoint: The temperature at which the substance transitions from a solid to a liquid.\n- temperature: The current temperature of the substance in degrees Celsius.\n\nThe `Substance` class defines an object that can exist in different states of matter (solid, liquid, gas) depending on its temperature. The class inherits from `GameObject`, indicating it is an entity within the game world.\n\nUpon initialization, the `Substance` object sets several critical properties related to its physical state and appearance based on the given parameters: `solidName`, `liquidName`, `gasName`, `solidShapeName`, `boilingPoint`, `meltingPoint`, and `currentTemperatureCelsius`. These properties define the names of the substance in different states, the shape name when solid, and the temperature thresholds for changing states.\n\nThe `tick` method is called within the `__init__` method and is responsible for updating the substance's state of matter and its name based on the current temperature. This method checks the current temperature against the melting and boiling points to determine the substance's state (solid, liquid, or gas). It then updates the `stateOfMatter` property and the object's name to reflect this state, incorporating the unique identifier (`uuid`) for clarity and uniqueness in the game world.\n\n- If the temperature is below or equal to the melting point, the substance is considered solid, and its name is set to include the solid name and shape name.\n- If the temperature is above the melting point but below or equal to the boiling point, the substance is considered liquid, and its name is set to the liquid name.\n- If the temperature is above the boiling point, the substance is considered gas, and its name is set to the gas name.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a descriptive string for the substance, adjusting the description based on the substance's current state of matter. For solids, it uses \"a\" followed by the name, and for liquids and gases, it uses \"some\" followed by the name, reflecting the typical way these states of matter are referred to in English.==========\nObject: Door\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- is_locked: Indicates whether the door is locked or not. A door can be locked, preventing it from being opened without a key.\n- is_open: Indicates whether the door is open or not. This property determines if the door is currently open, allowing passage, or closed, blocking passage.\n\nThe `Door` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no changes to the object properties at each game tick to describe.\n\nThe `open` method of the `Door` class allows for the door to be opened if it is not locked or if the correct key is provided. If the door is already open, it returns a message stating so. If the door is locked and no key is provided, it returns a message stating that the door is locked. If the door is locked and a key is provided, it unlocks and opens the door, updating the `is_locked` and `is_open` properties accordingly.\n\nThe `close` method allows for the door to be closed if it is open. If the door is already closed, it returns a message stating so. Otherwise, it updates the `is_open` property to indicate that the door is now closed.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the door's current state, indicating whether it is open, closed, or locked, based on the `is_open` and `is_locked` properties.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a \"world\" or environment within the game, specifically named as a \"workshop\" in this case. The critical aspect of this class lies in its role as a container for other objects, which can be anything that exists within this workshop environment.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the workshop and lists all contained objects, making it clear that the World object serves as a comprehensive container for the game's environment. This method enhances the game's interactivity by allowing players to visualize the workshop's contents through detailed or brief descriptions, depending on the `makeDetailed` flag. However, without a `tick` method, there are no properties that change over time or with each game tick in this class.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. However, it's important to note the unique role this class likely plays in the game, given its name and methods.\n\n1. **Inheritance from Container**: By inheriting from `Container`, the `Agent` class can hold other objects. This implies that the agent (likely representing the player or an NPC) can carry items, similar to how a player's inventory would work in many text-based games.\n\n2. **GameObject Initialization**: The call to `GameObject.__init__(self, \"agent\")` suggests that every agent is also a game object, which means it has properties and methods defined in the `GameObject` class. This could include identifiers, descriptions, and possibly location within the game world.\n\n3. **getReferents Method**: This method returns `[\"yourself\"]`, indicating that in the context of the game, the agent can refer to itself. This is particularly useful for text parsing and command interpretation within the game, allowing the game to understand commands directed towards the player character or NPC by the player.\n\n4. **makeDescriptionStr Method**: This method returns a simple string `\"yourself\"` when called, with the `makeDetailed` flag not altering its behavior. This suggests that, in its current form, the agent's description is static and not affected by its state or contents. However, this method could be overridden in subclasses to provide more detailed descriptions based on the agent's current state, inventory, or other dynamic properties.\n\nIn summary, the `Agent` class represents a character or entity in the game capable of carrying items. It is identified as \"yourself\" within the game, suggesting it could be the player's character. The class does not define any new critical properties but relies on its inheritance from `Container` to allow it to hold items, and from `GameObject` for basic game object functionality. The methods provided give a basic framework for how the agent can be referred to and described within the game.==========\n",
    "blood-type": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or by other means.\n\nMethods and Behavior:\n- The `GameObject` class does not directly inherit from any other classes, making it a foundational class in the game's object hierarchy.\n- The `__init__` method initializes critical properties such as `isContainer` and `isMoveable`, setting a default behavior for all objects that will inherit from `GameObject`. It also assigns a unique identifier (`uuid`) to each object, ensuring that each instance can be distinctly identified.\n- The `getProperty` method allows for the safe retrieval of property values, returning `None` if the specified property does not exist. This method enhances the robustness of the game by preventing errors that could occur from attempting to access non-existent properties.\n- The `addObject` and `removeObject` methods, along with `removeSelfFromContainer`, manage the containment relationships between objects. These methods enable objects to be added to or removed from the `contains` list of another object, effectively allowing for dynamic changes in the game's object hierarchy.\n- The `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive` method provides a way to retrieve all objects contained within an object, directly or indirectly, by recursively gathering all objects within its containment hierarchy. This could be useful for operations that need to consider every object within a container, such as searching or inventory management.\n- The `tick` method is defined but does not implement any behavior. It serves as a placeholder for derived classes to override with their specific behavior that needs to occur at each game tick, such as updating object states or triggering events.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list of names by which the object can be identified, starting with its unique name that includes its `uuid`. This could be used for parsing player commands or for display purposes in the game's user interface.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a basic human-readable description of the object, which can be extended or overridden by derived classes to include more detailed or specific information about the object's state or properties.\n\nIn summary, the `GameObject` class sets up a basic framework for all objects within the game, providing essential properties and methods for identification, containment, and description. It establishes a foundation upon which more complex behaviors and interactions can be built in derived classes.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts what actions can be performed with or on the container (e.g., placing objects inside it or taking objects from it).\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to True if successful, allowing objects to be placed inside or taken from the container.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to False if successful, potentially preventing objects from being placed inside or taken from the container.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Attempts to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method directly affects the contents of the container, adding the object to its list of contained objects if successful.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently contained within the container. This method directly affects the contents of the container, removing the object from its list of contained objects if successful.\n\nThe Container class, by inheriting from GameObject, also inherits any properties and methods defined in the GameObject class, integrating them with its specific container-related functionalities. The critical properties defined in the Container class enable complex interactions within the game, such as storing, retrieving, and manipulating objects in a way that reflects real-world logic and constraints.==========\nObject: Patient\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- blood_type: This property represents the patient's blood type, which is modeled as a tuple containing the basic blood type (A, B, AB, or O) and the Rh factor (positive or negative). This critical property is essential for medical simulations, especially in scenarios involving blood transfusions or medical treatments that are sensitive to blood type compatibility.\n- given_blood: This property is initially set to None, indicating that the patient has not been given any blood transfusions. This property can be updated to reflect the type of blood the patient has received during the game, which is crucial for tracking medical interventions and ensuring compatibility with the patient's blood type to avoid adverse reactions.==========\nObject: Blood\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nblood_type: This property represents the blood type of the object, which is modeled as a tuple containing the basic blood type (A, B, AB, O) and the Rh factor (positive or negative). This critical property is essential for identifying the specific characteristics of the blood, such as compatibility for transfusions in a medical or emergency scenario within the game.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- The World class does not explicitly define any critical properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a container for other objects, in this case, an \"emergency room\" within a text-based game environment. The critical aspect of this class lies in its ability to contain other objects and describe its contents to the player.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the emergency room and lists the objects it contains. This method enhances the game's interactivity by allowing players to visualize the game environment and the items within it. However, since there are no properties explicitly defined as critical within the `__init__` method and no `tick` method is present, there are no dynamic properties to describe that change over time or in response to game events.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `GameObject` and `Container` classes. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no specific critical properties to discuss. However, it's worth noting the unique aspects of this class as they relate to its role in the game.\n\nThe `Agent` class represents an entity in the game that can contain other objects, as indicated by its inheritance from the `Container` class. This suggests that the agent can carry or hold items, which is a common feature for player characters or NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in text-based games.\n\nThe `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, which implies that this class is intended to represent the player or an NPC from a first-person perspective. This method could be used in the game's text parsing system to recognize references to the player or the NPC when interpreting player input or generating descriptions.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is likely used to generate a text description of the agent within the game. The lack of detail in the description and the absence of a `makeDetailed` parameter effect suggest that the agent's description is not intended to be elaborate or change significantly in different contexts. This could be because the focus is more on the agent's actions or the objects they interact with rather than detailed self-descriptions.\n\nThere is no `tick` method defined in this class, so there are no properties that change at each game tick based on the provided code. This absence indicates that the `Agent` class, as defined, does not have behaviors or states that update automatically over time within the game loop, or such behaviors are managed elsewhere in the game's codebase.==========\n",
    "use-bandage": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or by other actions within the game environment.\n\nThe `GameObject` class also includes several methods that manage its interactions within the game world, such as adding or removing objects from containers, checking for specific properties, and handling the object's behavior during each game tick.\n\nDuring each game tick (as defined by the `tick` method):\n- If the object is combusting (`isCombusting` property is True), the `combustionTimeRemaining` property is decremented by 1. This simulates the object burning over time. Once `combustionTimeRemaining` reaches -1, it signifies that the object has finished combusting, and the `isCombusting` property is set to False, indicating the combustion process has ended.\n\nThis class serves as a foundational element in the game, providing basic attributes and behaviors that can be extended or modified by inheriting classes to create more complex objects within the game environment.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts what actions can be performed with or on the container (e.g., placing objects inside it or taking objects from it).\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to True if successful, allowing access to the container's contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to False if successful, securing the container's contents.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method affects the game state by changing the location of the object to inside the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently inside the container. This method changes the game state by altering the location of the object, effectively removing it from the container.\n\nThe Container class, inheriting from GameObject, is designed to represent objects in the game world that can hold other objects. Its properties and methods facilitate a wide range of interactions, such as opening, closing, placing objects inside, and taking objects out, which are essential for dynamic and interactive gameplay involving various items and containers.==========\nObject: Bandage Box\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isOpenable: Indicates that a bandage box can be opened and closed. This property is critical because it defines the interactive nature of the bandage box within the game, allowing players to change its state from open to closed and vice versa.\n- isOpen: Specifies whether the bandage box is open or closed at the start of the game. By default, the bandage box is closed. This property is crucial as it affects how the bandage box is interacted with and described within the game. If the box is closed, players may need to open it to access its contents, adding a layer of interaction.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a dynamic description of the bandage box based on its current state (open or closed) and its contents. If the box is closed, the description simply states that it is closed. If the box is open, the description changes to reflect the contents of the box, listing the items inside if there are any, or stating that it appears to be empty if there are no items. This method enhances the immersive experience by providing detailed, context-sensitive descriptions of the bandage box, allowing players to understand the state of the box and its contents at a glance.==========\nObject: Bandage\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject`. The critical property inherited and set in the `__init__` method is the `name` of the object, which is \"bandage\". This property is used to identify the object within the game and is utilized in the `makeDescriptionStr` method to generate a human-readable description of the object.\n\nThe `Bandage` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior defined for how its properties change at each game tick. The primary functionality of this class is to provide a basic representation of a bandage within the game, with the ability to generate a simple description of itself. The description can be made more detailed if needed, but in this implementation, the detailed flag does not alter the description, as no additional properties or complex behaviors are defined for the bandage.==========\nObject: Person\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- containerPrefix: This property is set to \"on\", which is a unique choice reflecting the conceptual model where items such as bandages are considered to be placed \"on\" a person rather than \"in\". This choice of preposition is more natural when describing items associated with a person, especially in the context of a text game where physical interactions are described textually.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a human-readable string that describes the person object, including any items that are associated with (or contained by) the person. If the person has any items, the method constructs a sentence that lists these items, using natural language to make the description more immersive and intuitive. For example, if a person object contains a bandage and a potion, the description might read \"a person that looks to have a bandage and a potion,\" reflecting the items \"on\" the person. This method enhances the game's narrative by providing detailed descriptions of characters and their possessions, contributing to a richer game experience. \n\nThe class does not contain a `tick` method, so there's no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick. This means the person object's state remains static over time unless acted upon by other objects or game events.==========\nObject: BodyPart\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- hasWound: Indicates whether this body part has a wound that needs a bandage. This is a critical property because it directly affects the gameplay by determining if a body part requires medical attention, such as applying a bandage.\n- isMoveable: This property is set to False, indicating that the body part cannot be moved. This property is critical in the context of the game's mechanics, as it reflects the realism that body parts are not items that can be moved around independently.\n\nMethods:\n- placeObjectInContainer: This method overrides the base class method to include a special check for Clothing objects. It ensures that clothing is only placed on the appropriate body part by checking if the body part's name is listed in the clothing's \"bodyPartItFits\" property. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining the game's realism and ensuring that players can only dress characters appropriately.\n- makeDescriptionStr: This method generates a human-readable string that describes the body part, including whether it has a wound, a bandage, or other items on it. The description changes based on the body part's state, such as having a wound or being covered with a bandage or other items. This dynamic description enhances the game's interactivity and realism by providing players with detailed feedback on the state of their character's body parts.\n\nThe `BodyPart` class is designed to represent a body part of a character in the game, with the ability to hold items like bandages, which is indicated by its inheritance from the `Container` class. The critical properties and methods of the `BodyPart` class are focused on managing wounds and the application of appropriate items, such as bandages or clothing, to the body part. This functionality is essential for games that include elements of survival, health management, or detailed character customization.==========\nObject: Sticker\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nstickerDescription: This property holds the description of the sticker, which is a critical aspect of its identity within the game. This description is used to generate a human-readable string that uniquely identifies the sticker, making it recognizable to the player.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method utilizes the `stickerDescription` to create a detailed or simple description of the sticker, depending on the `makeDetailed` flag. However, in this implementation, the `makeDetailed` flag does not alter the output, resulting in the same description regardless of its value. The description is formatted as \"a sticker\" followed by the specific `stickerDescription` provided during the object's initialization, allowing for a wide variety of stickers to be represented within the game.==========\nObject: Clothing\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nbodyPartItFits: a list indicating which body parts the clothing item fits. This property is critical for determining compatibility with characters or NPCs in the game, ensuring that clothing items are only used or worn on the appropriate body parts.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties: None specified as critical within the `__init__` function.\n\nThe `World` class does not have any explicitly commented critical properties within its `__init__` method, nor does it contain a `tick` method to describe changes to its properties over time. However, by inheriting from the `Container` class, it implicitly gains the ability to contain other objects, which is a critical aspect of its functionality, especially for a class named `World` that likely serves as the main environment or space in the game where various objects and entities are placed.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the `World` object, specifically designed to describe a \"bathroom\" environment. This method iterates through all objects contained within the `World` (in this case, the bathroom) and appends their descriptions to the output string. This functionality is critical for providing players with a detailed view of their surroundings, including all objects present in the current environment, thereby enhancing the immersive experience of the game.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, there are no specific critical properties to discuss based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class is designed to represent an agent (likely the player or an NPC) within the game. It inherits from the `Container` class, which suggests that the agent can hold or contain other objects, similar to how a player might carry items in an inventory.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this method is used to refer to the agent within the game's narrative or command parsing context. This could be useful for commands or descriptions that involve the player directly.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is likely used to generate a textual description of the agent. The `makeDetailed` parameter is available but not used in the provided implementation, suggesting that there could be a more detailed description option available for future expansion or within other parts of the game that inherit or extend this class.\n\nSince there is no `tick` method defined in the provided class, there's no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.==========\n",
    "conductivity": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects can be relocated within the game environment.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. It includes mechanisms for handling unique identifiers (UUIDs), naming, containment (both holding other objects and being contained within another object), and property management.\n\nCritical Methods and Their Effects:\n- `addObject(self, obj)`: Adds an object to this container, effectively making this object its parent container. This method also removes the object from any previous container it might have been in, ensuring that objects are not simultaneously contained in multiple locations.\n- `removeObject(self, obj)`: Removes an object from this container, clearing its parent container property. This is essential for managing the game's state, ensuring that objects are accurately tracked as they are moved or removed.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer(self)`: Removes this object from its current container, if any. This method is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the game's object containment hierarchy, allowing objects to be freely moved around the game world.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive(self)`: Retrieves all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects, recursively. This method is useful for operations that need to consider every object within a container, no matter how deeply nested.\n- `containsItemWithName(self, name)`: Searches for objects contained directly within this object (non-recursively) that have a specific name. This method is useful for finding specific objects within a container based on their name.\n- `tick(self)`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden by subclasses that need to perform updates at each game tick. This method is critical for objects that have properties or states that change over time.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not directly change any properties in its `tick` method since it's a base class designed for inheritance and doesn't implement specific behavior. Subclasses are expected to override this method to implement object-specific behavior that occurs at each game tick.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container, which means it can hold other objects. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other items within the game world.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property because it directly impacts what actions can be performed with or on the container (e.g., placing items inside or taking them out).\n- containerPrefix: This property defines the preposition used to describe the location of items relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for items inside the container). It's critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure and a boolean flag representing the outcome. This method directly manipulates the 'isOpen' property based on the conditions met.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure and a boolean flag representing the outcome. Similar to openContainer, this method changes the 'isOpen' property when the action is successful.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message about the action's success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object to inside the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently inside the container. It returns a message, a reference to the object (if successful), and a boolean flag. This method impacts the game by changing the object's location from being inside the container to elsewhere.\n\nThe Container class, through its properties and methods, provides a foundational mechanism for objects in the game world to hold other objects, thereby enabling complex interactions such as storing, retrieving, and manipulating items within containers. This functionality is essential for creating a dynamic and interactive game environment.==========\nObject: ElectricalObject\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- is_electrical_object: This property indicates that the object is an electrical object within the game. It is set to True to signify its nature and possibly its interaction with other electrical systems or objects within the game environment.\n- conductive: This property specifies whether the electrical object can conduct electricity. Its value is determined at the object's initialization and reflects its ability to participate in electrical circuits or conduct electrical current. This could affect how the object interacts with other objects or the environment, especially in puzzles or tasks requiring electrical conductivity.\n- connects: This property details the object's potential connections to other objects through specified terminals (\"terminal1\" and \"terminal2\"). Each terminal is initially set to a tuple of (None, None), indicating that they are not connected to anything. This property is critical for defining how the object can be integrated into electrical circuits or systems within the game. It allows for dynamic connections between objects, enabling complex interactions such as completing circuits or creating devices that affect the game environment or solve puzzles.\n\nThe `disconnect` method allows for the disconnection of the object from whatever it is connected to via a specified terminal. This action sets both the object's internal `connects` dictionary and its `properties[\"connects\"]` dictionary for the specified terminal to (None, None), effectively severing any electrical or logical connection that terminal had. This method is crucial for dynamically altering the game's state by enabling or disabling electrical connections, which can lead to changes in the environment, puzzle states, or interaction capabilities with other objects.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a descriptive string for the object based on its current state, particularly focusing on its connections. The description changes depending on whether the terminals are connected to something. If both terminals are disconnected, it simply returns the name of the object. If one or both terminals are connected, it includes information about what each connected terminal is connected to, providing a clear representation of the object's current state in terms of its electrical connections. This method is useful for giving players feedback about the state of electrical objects and their connections within the game environment.==========\nObject: Battery\nInherits: ElectricalObject\nProperties:\nconnects: This property represents the connections for the cathode and anode of the battery. Each key ('cathode' and 'anode') maps to a tuple, where the first element is intended to represent the object (or device) connected to that terminal of the battery, and the second element could represent additional details about the connection, such as the connection strength or type. Initially, both connections are set to `(None, None)`, indicating that nothing is connected to either the cathode or the anode. This setup allows for the dynamic connection of devices or other electrical objects to the battery within the game, facilitating interactions such as powering devices or forming circuits.==========\nObject: LightBulb\nInherits: ElectricalObject\nProperties:\n- on: Indicates whether the light bulb is on or off.\n\nThe `LightBulb` class inherits from `ElectricalObject`, which suggests it is part of a simulation involving electrical components. The critical property here is 'on', which is a boolean indicating whether the light bulb is currently powered on or off. This property is initially set to False, meaning the light bulb starts in the off state.\n\nThe `connectsToBattery` method is designed to check if the light bulb is part of a conductive circuit that includes at least one battery. It does this by traversing through connected objects starting from the light bulb itself, checking for conductivity and the presence of a battery in the circuit. If a complete conductive path back to the light bulb is found without encountering a non-conductive object and at least one battery is found in the circuit, the method returns True, indicating the light bulb is correctly connected to a battery within a conductive circuit. Otherwise, it returns False.\n\nThe `tick` method is called at each game tick and determines whether the light bulb should be turned on or off based on its current circuit configuration. It uses the `connectsToBattery` method to check if the light bulb is in a conductive circuit with a battery. If so, the light bulb is turned on (`self.properties['on'] = True`); otherwise, it is turned off (`self.properties['on'] = False`). This means the light bulb's state can change dynamically during the game based on how it is connected to other objects.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the light bulb's current state (on or off) and its connections. It checks the connections of the light bulb to other objects and includes this information in the description. This method provides a textual representation of the light bulb's status and connections, which can be useful for debugging or providing game feedback to the player.==========\nObject: Wire\nInherits: ElectricalObject\nProperties:\nis_wire: Indicates that the object is indeed a wire, distinguishing it from other types of electrical objects. This property is set to True, confirming its identity as a wire within the game's context. \n\nSince there is no `tick` method function provided in the Wire class, there's no need to describe how the object properties will be changed at each game tick.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties: None specified directly in the `__init__` method.\n\nThe `World` class does not explicitly define any new properties in its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `Container` class. It is designed to represent a \"world\" or \"room\" within a text game, acting as a container for other objects. The critical aspect of this class is its role in organizing and containing other game objects, which can be anything from items the player can interact with to NPCs (non-player characters) or other environmental features.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the world (or room) and its contents. If the world contains other objects, it lists them by calling their `makeDescriptionStr` method, which suggests that objects contained within the world should also implement this method to provide a description of themselves. This method supports creating a detailed narrative view of the room's contents, enhancing the text-based gameplay experience by giving players a textual representation of their surroundings and the items within those surroundings.\n\nSince there is no `tick` method defined in the `World` class, there's no behavior specified for how the properties of the world or its contents might change over time or in response to game ticks. The primary functionality of this class, as defined, is to serve as a container that can describe itself and its contents to the player.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `GameObject` and `Container` classes. Therefore, there are no specific critical properties to discuss based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class is designed to represent an agent (e.g., a player character or an NPC) within the game. It inherits from the `Container` class, suggesting that the agent can hold or contain other objects, similar to how a player might carry items in an inventory.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this method is likely used to identify the agent within the game's narrative or command parsing system. This could be useful for commands or descriptions that refer to the player or agent themselves.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This suggests that, by default, the agent's description in the game is minimal and self-referential. This method could be overridden in subclasses or extended to provide more detailed descriptions based on the agent's state or inventory contents if `makeDetailed` is `True`.\n\nTick Method:\n- There is no `tick` method defined in the provided class definition, so there are no changes to the object's properties at each game tick to describe.==========\n",
    "space-walk": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting they can be relocated within the game environment unless this property is set otherwise.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic attributes and methods that are common across various types of objects. It includes mechanisms for handling object identification (through a unique ID or UUID), naming, containment (both holding other objects and being contained within another object), and property management.\n\nCritical methods include:\n- `getProperty`: Safely retrieves a property value of the object, returning `None` if the property does not exist. This method ensures that attempts to access undefined properties do not result in errors.\n- `addObject` and `removeObject`: These methods manage the containment relationship, allowing objects to be added to or removed from this object's \"contains\" list, effectively managing which objects are contained within this one.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer`: Allows the object to remove itself from its parent container, if it has one, ensuring the object is no longer considered to be contained within that parent.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive`: Retrieves a list of all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects, allowing for a comprehensive view of all objects within its containment hierarchy.\n- `containsItemWithName`: Searches for and returns objects contained directly within this object (non-recursively) that match a given name, facilitating object lookup based on names.\n- `tick`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden in subclasses, where it can be used to implement updates that should occur at each tick (or step) of the game, such as changes in object state or properties.\n- `getReferents`: Returns a list of names (referents) by which the object can be identified, primarily its own name in this base implementation.\n- `makeDescriptionStr`: Generates a human-readable description of the object, which can be used to represent the object textually within the game. This method can be overridden in subclasses to provide more detailed or specific descriptions.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not directly inherit from any other classes, making it a base class from which other more specific game object classes can be derived. Its design allows for significant flexibility and extensibility in defining various types of objects within the game world.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to place or take objects).\n- isOpen: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the contents within the container. If a container is closed, players may not be able to access its contents without first opening it.\n- containerPrefix: This property defines how the container is referred to in relation to contained objects (e.g., \"in\" for \"in the box\"). It's critical for generating descriptive text that accurately reflects the spatial relationship between the container and its contents.\n\nMethods and Their Impact on Properties:\n- openContainer: This method attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. Success in opening the container changes the `isOpen` property to True, indicating the container is now open.\n- closeContainer: This method attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. Successfully closing the container changes the `isOpen` property to False, indicating the container is now closed.\n- placeObjectInContainer: This method attempts to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. Success in this action means the object is added to the container's contents.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: This method attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently contained within. Success in this action means the object is removed from the container's contents.\n\nThe `Container` class, by defining these properties and methods, allows for a wide range of interactions in the game, enabling objects to be stored, retrieved, and manipulated within containers. This functionality is essential for creating a dynamic and interactive game environment where players can interact with objects in meaningful ways.==========\nObject: Room\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isOuterSpace: Indicates whether the room is in outer space or not. This is a critical property because it affects how the room interacts with other game mechanics, such as the ability to survive without a spacesuit or the behavior of objects and characters within the room.\n\nThe `Room` class inherits from the `Container` class, which suggests that it can contain other objects, similar to how a physical room can contain furniture, items, or even characters. The `isMoveable` property is set to `False`, indicating that, as expected, the room cannot be moved.\n\nThe `connects` dictionary is used to keep track of other rooms that this room connects to, with the keys being the connected rooms and the values being the doors (or other passage ways) that connect them. This setup allows for the creation of a map or network of rooms within the game, facilitating player movement and exploration.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the room, including a list of objects contained within the room and a description of connections to other rooms. This method enhances the game's narrative by providing detailed descriptions that can help players visualize their surroundings and make informed decisions based on the room's contents and connections.\n\nThe `connect` method allows for the dynamic linking of rooms, enabling the creation or modification of the game map at runtime. This can be used to unlock new areas or change the game environment in response to player actions or events within the game.\n\nThe `connectsToOuterSpace` method checks if there is a path from the current room to an outer space room without encountering any closed doors. This method is particularly important for game mechanics involving the need to escape or navigate through a series of rooms to reach outer space, possibly as part of a puzzle or challenge within the game. It recursively explores connected rooms, marking them as visited to avoid infinite loops, and checks the `isOuterSpace` property and the state of doors (open or closed) to determine if a path exists. This functionality could be critical in scenarios where reaching outer space is a game objective or where avoiding exposure to outer space is necessary for survival.==========\nObject: Door\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- connects: This property is a tuple containing the names of the two rooms that the door connects. It represents the critical relationship between two distinct spaces in the game, allowing for movement or visibility between these rooms when the door is open.\n- is_open: A boolean value indicating whether the door is currently open or closed. This property is critical for determining if characters can move through the door or if they need to perform an action (like opening the door) first.\n\nThe `Door` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no changes to its properties at each game tick based on this implementation.\n\nMethods and Their Effects:\n- `get_curr_room`: This method determines which of the two rooms connected by the door contains the \"agent\" (presumably the player or a character controlled by the player). It's used to identify the current room of the agent relative to the door, which is essential for actions like opening or closing the door.\n- `open`: This method attempts to open the door if it is not already open and if the action is being attempted from a room that the door connects. It changes the `is_open` property to `True` if successful, allowing passage between the connected rooms.\n- `close`: Similar to the `open` method, this method attempts to close the door if it is not already closed and if the action is being attempted from a room that the door connects. It changes the `is_open` property to `False`, preventing passage between the connected rooms.\n- `getReferents`: This method provides a textual reference to the door based on the current room of the agent, aiding in the identification of the door in commands or descriptions.\n- `makeDescriptionStr`: This method generates a descriptive string for the door, indicating its name, which room it leads to (if applicable), and whether it is open or closed. This description is useful for providing players with a textual representation of the door's state and its relation to the surrounding environment.==========\nObject: SpaceSuit\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nThe provided code snippet for the `SpaceSuit` class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond the basic initialization inherited from `GameObject`. Since there are no properties commented as critical within the `__init__` function and no `tick` method is provided, there are no specific object properties or changes at each game tick to explain based on the given code.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a \"world\" in a text-based game, which can contain other objects, including rooms, items, and possibly characters.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method is particularly noteworthy. It is designed to generate a textual description of a room within the world, including a list of objects contained in the room and connections (doors) to other rooms. This method takes two parameters: `room`, which is the room object to describe, and `makeDetailed`, which is a boolean indicating whether a detailed description is requested.\n\n- The method starts by describing the room itself, mentioning that the player finds themselves in the specified room and listing the objects contained within the room. Each object's description is retrieved by calling its `makeDescriptionStr` method, which suggests that all objects within the room are expected to implement this method, allowing for a polymorphic approach to describing different types of objects.\n\n- After listing the objects in the room, the method proceeds to describe room connections. It iterates through the room's `connects` dictionary, which presumably maps directions or identifiers to door objects (or similar connection objects). For each connection, it calls the `makeDescriptionStr` method of the door object, passing the current room as a parameter. This allows the door to provide a context-aware description, such as indicating whether it leads out of the current room or into another specific room.\n\nIn summary, the World class in this text-based game framework is designed to manage and describe the game's environment, specifically focusing on the spatial arrangement of rooms and their contents. It leverages the Container class's capabilities to hold and manage objects within the game world, extending those capabilities with methods tailored to generating textual descriptions of the game's spaces and the connections between them.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- wearSpaceSuit: Indicates whether the agent is wearing a space suit or not. Initially set to False, meaning the agent is not wearing a space suit.\n- die: Indicates whether the agent is dead or not. Initially set to False, meaning the agent is alive.\n\nThe `Agent` class inherits from the `Container` class, which suggests that the agent can contain other objects, similar to how a container can. This could be used to simulate the agent carrying items.\n\nThe critical properties of the `Agent` object include `wearSpaceSuit` and `die`. The `wearSpaceSuit` property is crucial for determining the agent's survival in environments that require a space suit, such as outer space. The `die` property is a boolean that represents the agent's life state, where `True` indicates that the agent has died.\n\nThe `tick` method in the `Agent` class is responsible for updating the agent's properties at each game tick. Specifically, it checks if the agent's current location (`parentContainer`) connects to outer space and if the agent is not wearing a space suit (`wearSpaceSuit` is False). If both conditions are met, it sets the `die` property to True, indicating that the agent dies due to exposure to outer space without proper protection. This method demonstrates how the agent's survival is directly influenced by their environment and actions (or lack thereof) within the game.==========\n",
    "wash-clothes": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting they can be relocated within the game environment unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common across various types of objects. It includes mechanisms for handling object identification (through a unique ID or UUID), containment (whether an object can contain other objects and the management of such relationships), and basic property management (setting, getting, and checking properties).\n\nCritical Methods and Their Effects:\n- `addObject(self, obj)`: Adds an object to this object's containment list, effectively making this object a container for the added object. This method also handles removing the object from its previous container, if any, and updating the parent container reference.\n- `removeObject(self, obj)`: Removes an object from this object's containment list, severing the containment relationship between this object and the removed object.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer(self)`: Removes this object from its current container, if it has one, effectively updating the containment relationships to reflect this change.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive(self)`: Returns a list of all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects, allowing for a recursive traversal of the containment hierarchy.\n- `tick(self)`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden in subclasses. It is designed to perform any updates or checks that need to occur at each game tick, such as updating object states or properties based on game logic.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not directly change any properties in its `tick` method, as it is implemented as a pass-through function. This method is meant to be overridden by subclasses that require specific behaviors to be executed at each game tick.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container, meaning it can hold other objects. This is a critical property as it defines the object's ability to contain other items within the game, affecting how players can interact with it.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects the player's ability to access the contents of the container. If a container is not openable, it implies that its contents are always accessible (if open) or inaccessible (if closed by default and cannot be opened).\n- isOpen: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed. This is a critical property for containers that can be opened and closed, as it directly impacts the player's ability to place objects in the container or take objects from it. The accessibility of the container's contents is contingent upon this property.\n- containerPrefix: This property defines how the container is referred to in relation to contained objects (e.g., \"in the box\", \"on the shelf\"). It's critical for generating descriptive text about where objects are located within the game world, enhancing the game's narrative and spatial understanding for the player.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and not already open. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to True if successful, allowing access to the container's contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and not already closed. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to False if successful, restricting access to the container's contents.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Attempts to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object to within the container, provided the action is permissible based on the object and container properties.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is moveable and contained within. This method similarly affects the game's state by changing the location of an object from within the container to outside, again contingent on the action being permissible.\n\nThe Container class, through its properties and methods, plays a fundamental role in the game's interaction model, particularly in how players manage items and navigate the game's spaces. The ability to open, close, place objects in, and take objects from containers adds a layer of complexity and realism to the game environment.==========\nObject: Device\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isDevice: Indicates that this object is a device. This property is set to True, meaning every instance of this class or its subclasses is recognized as a device within the game.\n- isActivatable: Determines whether the device can be turned on or off. This is set to True, indicating that the device is designed to have an active (on) and inactive (off) state.\n- isOn: Tracks the current state of the device, whether it is on or off. Initially set to False, indicating that devices start in the off state.\n\nMethods:\n- turnOn: Attempts to turn the device on. If the device is not activatable or is already on, it returns an error message and a success flag set to False. Otherwise, it sets `isOn` to True and returns a success message and flag.\n- turnOff: Attempts to turn the device off. Similar to `turnOn`, but for turning the device off. If the device is not activatable or is already off, it returns an error message and a success flag set to False. Otherwise, it sets `isOn` to False and returns a success message and flag.\n- useWithObject: Provides a mechanism to attempt using the device with another object, known as the patient object. By default, it returns a message indicating uncertainty about how to use the device with the specified object, along with a success flag set to False. This method is likely intended to be overridden in subclasses where specific interactions between devices and other objects are defined.\n- makeDescriptionStr: Generates a human-readable description of the device, including its name and whether it is currently on or off. This method enhances the game's user interface by providing clear information about the state of devices to the player.\n\nThe `Device` class is designed to be a base class for any object in the game that functions as a device, providing common functionality such as turning on and off, and setting a foundation for more specific device behaviors in subclasses.==========\nObject: Washing Machine\nInherits: Container, Device\n\nProperties:\n- isOpenable: Indicates that a washing machine can be opened, allowing for interaction such as loading or unloading items.\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the washing machine door, being closed by default. This affects whether the machine can be started or not.\n- isMoveable: Due to its weight and intended stationary use, a washing machine is not designed to be moved around in the game environment.\n- cycleStage: Represents the current operational stage of the washing machine's cycle, where 0 signifies not running, 1 indicates the washing process, and 2 marks the cycle as finished.\n- finishedCycle: A boolean flag that turns true once the washing cycle is complete. This property is reset when the washing machine is opened post-cycle.\n\nBehavior on Tick:\n- If the washing machine is open, it automatically turns off, resets the finishedCycle flag to False, and sets the cycleStage back to 0, indicating that any ongoing or completed cycle is halted and reset.\n- When the washing machine is on, it progresses through its cycle stages with each tick. The cycleStage increments until it reaches 3, with specific actions occurring at stages 2 and 3:\n    - At stage 2, the machine checks for the presence of detergent. If found, it cleans the clothes (sets `isDirty` to False for any Clothes objects). Regardless of detergent presence, all Clothes objects become wet (`isWet` = True). Detergent used in the cycle is removed from the machine.\n    - Reaching stage 3 signifies the end of the cycle. The machine sets the finishedCycle flag to True, resets the cycleStage to 0, and turns off, indicating the cycle's completion.\n- If the washing machine is off, no actions are performed, and the cycle does not progress.\n\nDescription Generation:\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual representation of the washing machine's current state, including whether it is on or off, open or closed, has completed a cycle (indicated by a blinking green light), and whether it contains any items. This description can be detailed, listing the specific items contained within the machine if requested.==========\nObject: Dryer\nInherits: Container, Device\n\nProperties:\n- isOpenable: Indicates that a dryer can be opened, allowing for interaction such as loading or unloading items.\n- isOpen: Reflects whether the dryer is currently open or closed, with the default state being closed. This affects whether the dryer can be turned on and influences the behavior during a tick.\n- isMoveable: Signifies that the dryer is too heavy to be moved, which is typical for such appliances and affects how players can interact with it in the game environment.\n- cycleStage: Represents the current stage of the dryer's operation cycle. Initially set to 0 (not running), it progresses through stages (1 for drying, 2 for finished) as the game ticks, reflecting the operational state of the dryer.\n- finishedCycle: A boolean flag that becomes True once the dryer has completed its drying cycle. This property is reset when the dryer is opened, indicating to the player that the drying process is complete and the contents are ready to be removed.\n\nTick Method Behavior:\n- If the dryer is open during a tick, it automatically turns off, resets the finishedCycle flag to False, and sets the cycleStage back to 0, indicating that the drying process has been interrupted or is ready to start anew.\n- When the dryer is on, the tick method progresses the cycleStage by 1 until it reaches 3. At stage 2, it simulates drying the clothes by setting their 'isWet' property to False, assuming the objects inside are of type Clothes. This mimics the drying process.\n- Upon reaching stage 3, the method marks the drying cycle as finished by setting finishedCycle to True, resets the cycleStage to 0, and turns off the dryer, indicating the end of the drying process.\n- If the dryer is off, the tick method does not proceed with drying the clothes, maintaining the current state of the contents.\n\nThis behavior simulates a realistic operation of a dryer in a game, where the player must interact with the appliance by loading clothes, starting the cycle, and waiting for it to complete before unloading dry clothes. The properties and tick method together create a dynamic object that can affect gameplay through its operation and interaction with other objects (like clothes).==========\nObject: Clothes\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- isDirty: A boolean indicating whether the clothes are initially dirty or clean. This property affects how the object is referred to and described within the game. If `isDirty` is `True`, the clothes are considered dirty, affecting interactions and possibly player decisions regarding cleaning or using the clothes.\n- isWet: A boolean indicating whether the clothes are initially wet or dry. Similar to `isDirty`, this property influences the object's description and referents. If `isWet` is `True`, the clothes are considered wet, which could impact game mechanics related to drying clothes before use or handling them differently when wet.\n\nThe `Clothes` class allows for dynamic descriptions and referents based on its state (dirty/clean and wet/dry), enhancing the realism and interactivity within the game environment. These properties do not change with a tick method in the provided class definition, meaning their states are static unless altered by game events or player actions outside of the `tick` method context.==========\nObject: DetergentBottle\nInherits: Device\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Device class. It is identified as a \"bottle of detergent\" through its initialization in the Device class constructor.\n\nFunctionality:\n- The `useWithObject` method allows the DetergentBottle to interact with other objects in the game. Specifically, if the object it interacts with is a WashingMachine, it adds a Detergent object to the washing machine, simulating the action of adding detergent to it. This interaction returns a success message and a boolean flag indicating the action was successful (True). If the object is not a WashingMachine, it returns a message indicating uncertainty about how to use the detergent bottle with the specified object, along with a False flag to indicate failure.\n\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple description of the DetergentBottle object, which can be detailed or not based on the `makeDetailed` flag. However, in this implementation, the detail level does not alter the description, which remains \"a bottle of detergent\".\n\nTick Method:\n- This class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no properties that change at each game tick as per the provided code.==========\nObject: Detergent\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond its identification as \"detergent\". It inherits from GameObject, which suggests it has basic properties and behaviors of a game object but without additional functionality or properties specified in the provided code snippet. There are no properties commented as critical within the `__init__` function, and there is no `tick` method present, indicating that the properties of the Detergent object do not change over time based on game ticks.==========\nObject: Basket\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- isMoveable: Indicates that the basket cannot be moved. This property is set to False, meaning in the game, players or other objects cannot change the basket's location.\n- isOpenable: Specifies that the basket cannot be opened. This property being set to False suggests that the basket does not have a functionality for players to interact with it in a manner that involves opening or closing. \n\nThe Basket class does not contain a tick method, so there are no properties that change at each game tick to describe.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- The World class does not explicitly define any critical properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a room or a world in the text game, capable of containing other objects. The critical aspect of this class lies in its ability to aggregate and describe the objects it contains, rather than specific properties like temperature or openability.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the world or room, listing all contained objects and their descriptions. This method enhances the immersive experience by dynamically generating descriptions based on the current state of the world, including the objects it contains. However, since there's no `tick` method defined within the World class, there are no properties that change at each game tick directly within this class. Changes to the world or room's state would likely be managed externally or through interactions with the objects it contains.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no specific critical properties to discuss. However, it's worth noting the unique aspects of this class as it relates to its role in the game.\n\nThe `Agent` class represents an entity in the game that can contain other objects, as indicated by its inheritance from the `Container` class. This suggests that the agent can carry or hold items, which is a common feature in text-based adventure or simulation games. The `GameObject` initialization with \"agent\" as its name parameter indicates that this class is treated as a game object with a specific identifier.\n\nThe `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string \"yourself\", which implies that this object is intended to represent the player or an NPC (Non-Player Character) as themselves within the game world. This method could be used in the game's text parsing system to recognize references to the player or the NPC by commands or descriptions involving \"yourself\".\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string \"yourself\". This method is likely used to generate a text description of the agent object within the game. The `makeDetailed` parameter suggests that there could be a more detailed description available, but in this implementation, it does not alter the output, which remains a simple self-reference regardless of the parameter's value.\n\nIn summary, the `Agent` class is designed to represent a character in the game that can carry items and is referred to as \"yourself\" within the game's narrative or command system. There are no specific critical properties defined in the provided code snippet beyond the capabilities inherited from `Container` and the identity established through `GameObject`.==========\n",
    "mix-paint": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or through other game mechanics.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. It includes mechanisms for handling unique identifiers (UUIDs), naming, containment (both holding other objects and being contained within another object), and property management. The class also outlines a structure for updating object states through the `tick` method, which is intended to be overridden by subclasses to implement specific behavior that occurs at each game tick.\n\nCritical Methods and Their Effects:\n- `addObject(obj)`: Adds an object to this one, effectively making this object a container if it wasn't already considered one. This method also handles removing the object from its previous container, if any, and updating the parent-child relationship.\n- `removeObject(obj)`: Removes an object from this container, breaking the parent-child relationship between this object and the one being removed.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer()`: Removes this object from its parent container, if it has one, effectively detaching it from the container it was part of.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive()`: Retrieves a list of all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects, allowing for a comprehensive view of the containment hierarchy.\n- `containsItemWithName(name)`: Searches for objects directly contained within this one by name, providing a way to find specific objects without needing to know their exact identifiers or navigate the entire containment hierarchy.\n- `tick()`: A placeholder method meant to be overridden by subclasses to define behavior that occurs at each game tick, such as updating object states or triggering events. In the `GameObject` class, it does nothing, serving only as a template.\n\nThe `GameObject` class is designed to be extended by other classes to create more specific types of objects within the game, with the `isContainer` and `isMoveable` properties allowing for basic interaction and behavior customization. The inclusion of a unique identifier (UUID) for each object facilitates tracking and referencing objects throughout the game.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects within the game. Containers can hold other objects, making them essential for organizing and storing items in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players interact with the container. If a container is openable, players may need to open it to access its contents or close it to secure those contents.\n- isOpen: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property because it directly impacts what actions can be performed with or on the container. For example, objects can typically only be placed in or taken from a container if it is open.\n- containerPrefix: This property defines how the container is referred to in relation to contained objects (e.g., \"in\" the box, \"on\" the table). It's critical for generating accurate and understandable descriptions of where objects are located within the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to True if successful, allowing access to the container's contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to False if successful, securing the container's contents.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object, moving it into the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is indeed inside the container. This method changes the game's state by altering the location of an object, removing it from the container.\n\nEach of these methods impacts the game by altering the properties of objects and their relationships to one another, affecting how players can interact with the game world.==========\nObject: Cup\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isLiquidContainer: Indicates that the cup is capable of holding liquids. This is a critical property because it defines the primary function of the cup within the game, distinguishing it from other containers that might only hold solid objects. The property suggests that any game mechanics involving liquids (like pouring, drinking, or filling) would consider the cup as a viable object for such interactions.\n\nThe `Cup` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no changes to its properties at each game tick to describe. \n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a dynamic description of the cup based on its contents. If the cup contains other objects, it lists them as being contained \"in\" the cup, reflecting the `containerPrefix` property set to \"in\". This method enhances the interactivity and realism of the game by allowing players to receive updated descriptions of objects based on their current state, such as whether the cup is empty or what it contains.==========\nObject: Paint\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- color: This property stores the color of the paint, indicating what color the paint is when applied.\n- isPaint: This property is set to True, indicating that this object is indeed paint. This could be used in the game to differentiate paint from other types of objects.\n- isLiquid: This property is set to True, indicating that the paint is in a liquid form. This could affect how the paint is used or interacted with in the game, such as needing a container to hold it or being able to be mixed with other liquids.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent an \"art studio\" environment within the game, capable of containing other objects. The critical aspect of this class lies in its ability to contain other objects and describe its contents, rather than specific properties like temperature or openability.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the art studio and lists the objects it contains. This method enhances the immersive experience by detailing the environment and its contents to the player, but it does not modify any properties of the World object or the objects it contains.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. However, it's important to note the unique role this class likely plays in the game based on the methods provided.\n\n1. **Inheritance**: The `Agent` class inherits from the `Container` class. This inheritance implies that the `Agent` can hold other objects, similar to how a container can. This is a critical aspect of gameplay, as it allows the player or NPCs (non-player characters) to carry items within the game world.\n\n2. **Identification**: The `getReferents` method returns `[\"yourself\"]`, which suggests that objects of this class are used to represent the player or an NPC in the game. This method likely helps in identifying the object as the player character or as an NPC when parsing commands or descriptions.\n\n3. **Description**: The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns `\"yourself\"`. This method is designed to provide a textual description of the object. The simplicity of the return value here emphasizes the object's role as a representation of the player or an NPC. In a more detailed or interactive context, this method might be expanded to include descriptions of what the agent is carrying or their current state, but as it stands, it focuses on the agent's identity.\n\n**Summary**: The `Agent` class represents a character in the game that can carry items, indicated by its inheritance from the `Container` class. The methods provided focus on identifying and describing the agent, likely for use in narrative or command parsing contexts within the game. There are no critical properties explicitly defined in the `__init__` method related to gameplay mechanics like health, strength, etc., which might either be defined elsewhere or managed through the properties inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`.==========\n",
    "thermometer": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class and does not inherit from any other class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, allowing them to be transported or relocated within the game environment.\n- temperature: Sets the initial temperature of the object to 20 degrees Celsius. This property suggests that the game may simulate temperature effects or require temperature management for certain objects or scenarios.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. It includes mechanisms for managing an object's containment within other objects, tracking its unique identifier (UUID), and handling its basic properties such as movability, container status, and temperature. The class also includes methods for adding or removing objects from containers, recursively listing all contained objects, and generating descriptions of the object for game narration or interaction purposes.\n\nThe `tick` method in this class is empty, indicating that, by default, `GameObject` instances do not change with game ticks. However, this method can be overridden in subclasses to implement time-dependent behavior, allowing objects to change state or interact with their environment or other objects as the game progresses.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the container's contents. If a container is closed, players may not be able to place objects in it or take objects from it without first opening it.\n- containerPrefix: This property defines how the container is referred to in relation to contained objects (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). It's critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods and Their Impact on Properties:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method directly modifies the `isOpen` property by setting it to True when the container is successfully opened, thereby changing how players can interact with the container and its contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This method directly modifies the `isOpen` property by setting it to False when the container is successfully closed, affecting the accessibility of the container's contents.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Attempts to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method impacts the game state by potentially adding objects to the container's contents, thereby changing the container's state and possibly the object's location within the game world.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently contained within the container. This method impacts the game state by potentially removing objects from the container's contents, affecting both the container's state and the object's location within the game world.\n\nEach of these methods affects how players can interact with containers and their contents, making them fundamental to gameplay involving item management and environmental interaction.==========\nObject: LiquidContainer\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isOpenable: Indicates that the liquid container (e.g., a pot) cannot be opened. This property is critical because it defines the interaction capabilities with the object within the game. Since it is set to False, it means players cannot open or close the liquid container, which could imply that its contents are directly accessible or added without needing to open it first.\n\nThe `LiquidContainer` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there's no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a way to generate a textual description of the liquid container. It dynamically constructs a description based on whether the container is empty or contains items. If it contains items, it lists them, appending \"in it\" at the end, which aligns with the `containerPrefix` property set to \"in\". This method allows for a detailed or simple description, enhancing the interactive text-based gameplay by giving context about the contents of the liquid container.==========\nObject: Liquid\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\ntemperature: the initial temperature of the liquid in degrees Celsius.\n\nThis class does not contain a tick method, so there is no description of how its properties change at each game tick.==========\nObject: Thermometer\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method through comments or direct property assignments that are highlighted as critical. However, based on the functionality provided by the `useWithObject` method, we can infer the critical use of this object in the game context.\n\nThe `Thermometer` class is designed to interact with other objects in the game to read their temperature. This functionality is critical for gameplay scenarios where the temperature of objects needs to be monitored or checked. The method `useWithObject` allows the thermometer to be used on other game objects, except for instances of `Agent` or `Thermometer` itself, indicating that the thermometer cannot be used on players or other thermometers. When used on a valid object, it returns a string indicating the temperature of the object in Celsius degrees, assuming the object has a 'temperature' property accessible via `getProperty`.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple description of the thermometer, which can be enhanced with more details if needed, although the `makeDetailed` flag does not alter the output in the current implementation. This method ensures that the thermometer can be described within the game's narrative or inventory listings.\n\nNo `tick` method is present, indicating that the thermometer's properties or state do not change automatically with each game tick. Its primary function remains to read and report the temperature of other objects when explicitly used by the player or game logic.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a \"world\" or environment within the game, with the initial example given as a \"kitchen\". The critical aspect of this class lies in its ability to contain other objects, as inherited from the Container class, and organize them within this environment.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a way to generate a textual description of the world and its contents. When called, it constructs a string that begins with a brief introduction to the environment (\"You find yourself in a kitchen.\") and then lists all objects contained within this world. Each object's description is retrieved by calling its `makeDescriptionStr` method, allowing for a detailed or simple description based on the `makeDetailed` flag. This method showcases how the World object serves as a container for other objects, providing a structured way to present them to the player. \n\nThere is no `tick` method defined in this class, so there's no behavior described that changes the properties of the World object or its contents over time based on game ticks.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no specific critical properties to discuss. However, it's worth noting that as a `Container`, the `Agent` object can hold other objects, which is a significant aspect of its functionality in the game.\n\nThe `Agent` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there's no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.\n\nAdditional Methods:\n- `getReferents`: This method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that the agent can refer to itself. This could be used in the game's text interface to allow the player to perform actions on themselves or to check their own status.\n- `makeDescriptionStr`: This method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This suggests that when the game needs to describe the agent object, it will simply refer to it as \"yourself\", enhancing the immersion by personalizing the player's experience in the game narrative. This method supports an optional `makeDetailed` argument, but it does not alter the behavior in this implementation, always returning the same description.==========\n",
    "inclined-plane": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, which means they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or by other actions within the game environment.\n\nMethods:\n- `getProperty`: Safely retrieves a property of the object, returning `None` if the property doesn't exist. This method ensures that attempts to access undefined properties do not result in errors, facilitating safer and more robust code.\n- `addObject`: Adds an object to this container (if it is a container), removing it from its previous container. This method manages the relationships between containers and their contents, ensuring that objects are correctly moved between containers.\n- `removeObject`: Removes an object from this container. It is used to manage the contents of containers, ensuring that objects can be correctly removed when necessary.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer`: Removes the current object from whatever container it's currently in. This method allows objects to be autonomously removed from their parent container, facilitating actions like picking up an item in the game.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive`: Retrieves all objects contained within this object, recursively. This method is useful for getting a complete inventory of a container and all sub-containers within it.\n- `containsItemWithName`: Checks if the container directly contains an object with a specific name (not recursively). This method is useful for searching for specific items within a container without delving into nested containers.\n- `tick`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden in subclasses. It is meant to perform any internal updates that need to be performed at each step of the game, such as changing object properties over time.\n- `getReferents`: Returns a list of names (referents) that this object can be called by. This method is useful for identifying objects within the game, allowing for a variety of names or identifiers to be used.\n- `makeDescriptionStr`: Generates a human-readable string that describes this object. This method is crucial for providing textual descriptions of objects within the game, enhancing the player's understanding and interaction with the game world.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational element for creating objects within a text-based game, providing essential properties and methods for managing objects, their relationships, and their behaviors within the game environment.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to place or take objects).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the contents within the container. If a container is closed, players may not be able to place objects inside it or take objects from it without first opening the container.\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used in descriptions related to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and contextually appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in relation to the container.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to True if successful, allowing access to the container's contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to False if successful, securing the contents within the container.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object to within the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method changes the game's state by altering the location of an object, removing it from the container.\n- makeDescriptionStr: Generates a human-readable description of the container, which can be used to convey information about the container to the player. This method is important for providing feedback and context to the player as they interact with the game world.==========\nObject: InclinedPlane\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- acceleration: This property represents the acceleration a block can have when placed on the inclined plane. It reflects the angle of the inclined plane and the gravitational force component acting along the plane. A higher acceleration value indicates a steeper incline.\n- length: The length of the surface of the inclined plane. This property is critical as it determines how long an object takes to reach the bottom of the plane, assuming it starts from the top and accelerates uniformly down the plane.\n- objects: A dictionary that records the number of ticks that an object has been on the inclined plane. This is crucial for calculating the distance each object has traveled down the plane over time.\n\nThe `addObject` method adds an object to the inclined plane and initializes its tick count to 0 in the `objects` dictionary. This is essential for tracking how long the object has been on the plane.\n\nThe `removeObject` method removes an object from the inclined plane and also removes its entry from the `objects` dictionary, ceasing its motion tracking on the plane.\n\nThe `tick` method increments the tick count for each object on the inclined plane by 1. This simulates the passage of time and is critical for calculating the distance each object has traveled down the plane based on its acceleration and the time it has been on the plane.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a descriptive string for the inclined plane. If there are objects on the plane, it calculates the distance each object has traveled based on the formula for uniform acceleration (distance = 0.5 * acceleration * time^2). It then calculates what percentage of the total length of the inclined plane this distance represents. If the calculated distance exceeds the length of the inclined plane, it is capped at 100%. This method provides a dynamic description of the inclined plane's state, including the positions of objects on it.==========\nObject: Stopwatch\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- isActivated: Indicates whether the stopwatch is currently running or not.\n- tick: Represents the number of game ticks that have passed since the stopwatch was activated.\n\nThe `Stopwatch` class inherits from `GameObject`, which likely provides basic game object functionalities such as naming and possibly a position in the game world or interaction capabilities.\n\nCritical Properties Explained:\n- **isActivated**: This boolean property determines whether the stopwatch is currently counting time or not. When `False`, the stopwatch is not counting time, and when `True`, it indicates that the stopwatch has been started and is actively counting each game tick.\n- **tick**: This integer property counts the number of game ticks that have occurred since the stopwatch was activated. It serves as a simple measure of time, with each increment representing a single tick in the game's time system.\n\nBehavior with `tick` Method:\n- The `tick` method of the `Stopwatch` class is responsible for incrementing the `tick` property by 1 every game tick, but only if the stopwatch is activated (`isActivated` is `True`). This means that with each game tick, if the stopwatch is running, it accurately tracks the passage of time by increasing its `tick` count.\n- If the stopwatch is not activated (`isActivated` is `False`), the `tick` method does nothing, and the `tick` count remains unchanged.\n\nAdditional Method - `reset`:\n- The `reset` method allows for the stopwatch to be stopped and its `tick` count to be reset to 0. This is useful for starting the timing of a new event or action within the game after the stopwatch has been used previously.\n\nDescription Generation with `makeDescriptionStr`:\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the stopwatch, indicating whether it is activated or deactivated. If `makeDetailed` is `True`, it also includes the current `tick` count, giving a detailed status of the stopwatch, including how long it has been running. This can be useful for displaying the stopwatch's status to the player in a more informative way.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. The critical properties of the World object would therefore be those that are inherent to a Container, such as the ability to contain other objects. The World class represents a container that can hold multiple objects, similar to how a workshop might contain various tools and items.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method in the World class generates a string description of the workshop and lists all contained objects. This method enhances the user's immersion by providing a detailed view of what the workshop contains, which can include any number of objects that the World (workshop) has within it. Each object's description is obtained by calling its `makeDescriptionStr` method, allowing for a recursive detailing of objects within objects if necessary. However, this class does not have a `tick` method, so there's no description of how its properties change over time or in response to game ticks.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, there are no specific critical properties to discuss based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class is designed to represent an agent (likely the player or an NPC) within the game. It inherits from `Container`, suggesting that the agent can hold or contain other objects, similar to how a player might carry items in an inventory.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this method is used to refer to the agent within the game's narrative or command parsing context. This could be useful for commands or descriptions that involve the player directly.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This suggests that when the game needs to describe the agent, it will refer to them in a self-referential manner. This could be part of the game's narrative style, especially in text-based games where the player's actions are described back to them.\n- Since there is no `tick` method defined within the `Agent` class, there are no properties that change at each game tick as per the instructions provided. This means the class's behavior over time (in terms of properties changing automatically) is not defined in the provided code snippet.==========\n",
    "clean-energy": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or through other game mechanics.\n\nMethods and Behavior:\n- The `GameObject` class does not directly inherit from any other classes, making it a foundational class in the game's object hierarchy.\n- The `__init__` method initializes critical properties such as `isContainer` and `isMoveable`, sets a unique identifier (`uuid`) for each object, and assigns a name that includes this `uuid`.\n- The `getProperty` method allows for the safe retrieval of property values, returning `None` if the property does not exist, which can prevent errors when accessing undefined properties.\n- The `addObject` and `removeObject` methods manage the containment relationship between objects, allowing objects to be added to or removed from this object's `contains` list, effectively handling the parent-child relationship in the containment hierarchy.\n- The `removeSelfFromContainer` method allows an object to remove itself from its parent container, if it has one, ensuring the object is no longer considered contained by the parent.\n- The `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive` method retrieves all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects, allowing for a comprehensive list of all objects within the containment hierarchy.\n- The `containsItemWithName` method provides a way to find objects by name directly contained by this object, but it does not search recursively through nested objects.\n- The `tick` method is a placeholder in this class, meant to be overridden in subclasses to define behavior that occurs at each game tick, such as updating object properties or triggering events.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list of names or identifiers by which the object can be referred, which by default is just the object's name including its `uuid`.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a human-readable description of the object, which can be used to represent the object in game narratives or descriptions. By default, it simply returns the object's name, but it can be overridden in subclasses to provide more detailed descriptions.\n\nIn summary, the `GameObject` class serves as a base class for all objects within the game, providing essential properties and methods for object identification, containment, and basic interactions. It establishes a framework for more specialized objects to build upon, ensuring a consistent approach to object management within the game.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents or not).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the container's contents. If a container is closed, players may not be able to place objects in it or take objects from it without opening it first.\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to True if the container is successfully opened, allowing access to its contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to False if the container is successfully closed, securing its contents.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method affects the game state by potentially changing the location of an object, moving it into the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is moveable and currently inside the container. This method impacts the game state by potentially changing the location of an object, moving it out of the container.\n\nThe Container class, inheriting from GameObject, is designed to represent objects in the game world that can contain other objects. Its properties and methods facilitate a range of interactions, such as opening, closing, placing objects inside, and taking objects out, which are essential for dynamic and interactive gameplay involving various objects and containers.==========\nObject: Region\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\nresource: the resource that the region has, which can be 'sun', 'water', or 'wind'. This property determines the specific characteristic or natural resource advantage of the region, affecting its description and potentially how it interacts with objects or characters within the game. For example, a region with 'sun' as its resource has enough sunshine all year round, a region with 'water' is near a large river, and a region with 'wind' has steady wind. These characteristics could influence the activities or the growth of objects within the region.==========\nObject: PowerPlant\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- running_efficiency: This property represents the efficiency at which the power plant operates. Efficiency is a critical factor in determining how much of the input energy is converted into usable electrical energy. In this context, it likely affects how effectively the power plant converts its fuel or energy source into electricity. The efficiency is stored as a decimal (e.g., 0.9 for 90% efficiency), which means when calculating the actual output, this efficiency value will be multiplied by the capacity to determine the effective output power of the plant.\n- capacityKW: This property indicates the maximum output capacity of the power plant in kilowatts (KW). The capacity of a power plant is an important metric as it determines the maximum amount of electrical power the plant can generate at any given moment. However, the actual output power is determined by multiplying this capacity by the running efficiency of the plant. This means that if a plant has a high capacity but operates at low efficiency, its actual output might be less than a smaller plant operating at higher efficiency.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the power plant, including its name, current generation capacity in kW, and its operating efficiency as a percentage. This description is useful for understanding the power plant's capabilities and performance at a glance, especially in the context of a game where such details can influence decisions or gameplay mechanics.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. However, the structure and purpose of the World object can be inferred from the context provided in the `makeDescriptionStr` method.\n\nThe `World` class represents a container for regions within a text-based game, where each region is likely another object that can be contained within the \"world\". The critical aspect of this class, although not explicitly marked as a property in the code, is its role in managing and organizing these regions, which are part of the game's environment.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a dynamic description of the world based on its current state, specifically:\n- It starts by informing the player how many regions they are in charge of, which directly relates to the number of objects contained within the World object. This number can change as the game progresses, with regions possibly being added or removed from the world.\n- It encourages the player to modify power plants in these regions to use clean energy, implying a game mechanic focused on environmental management or sustainability.\n- It lists the descriptions of each contained region, providing detailed information about the state of each region. This suggests that each region object also implements a `makeDescriptionStr` method, which the World object calls to get a detailed description of the region.\n\nThis class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior described that changes the properties of the World object or its contained regions at each game tick. However, the dynamic nature of the `makeDescriptionStr` method suggests that the state of the world and its regions can change over time, likely influenced by player actions or other game mechanics not described in the provided code snippet.==========\n",
    "volume-stone": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class and does not inherit from any other class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects can be relocated within the game environment.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. It includes mechanisms for tracking the object's unique identifier (`uuid`), name, containment hierarchy (`parentContainer` and `contains`), and a generic properties dictionary (`properties`) for extending object attributes.\n\nCritical methods include:\n- `getProperty`: Safely retrieves a property value by name, returning `None` if the property does not exist. This method ensures that attempts to access undefined properties do not result in errors.\n- `addObject` and `removeObject`: Manage the containment relationship between objects. `addObject` allows an object to be added to the current object's `contains` list, effectively making the current object a container. `removeObject` removes an object from the `contains` list. These methods automatically update the `parentContainer` attribute of the objects involved, maintaining the integrity of the containment hierarchy.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer`: Allows an object to remove itself from its current container, if any. This method is useful for reorganizing objects within the game's spatial hierarchy.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive`: Recursively retrieves all objects contained within the current object, including those nested within other contained objects. This method is useful for operations that need to consider every object within a containment hierarchy.\n- `containsItemWithName`: Searches for objects with a specific name directly contained by the current object (non-recursively). This method can be used to find objects based on their names without considering the entire containment hierarchy.\n- `tick`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden in subclasses. It is designed to implement behavior that occurs at each game tick, such as updating object states or triggering events. In the `GameObject` class, it does nothing, serving as a default implementation.\n- `getReferents`: Returns a list of names (referents) by which the object can be identified. By default, this includes the object's name, but subclasses can override this method to provide additional or alternative referents.\n- `makeDescriptionStr`: Generates a human-readable description of the object. By default, it returns the object's name, but this method can be overridden in subclasses to provide more detailed or context-specific descriptions.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not contain a `tick` method that modifies properties; the `tick` method here is a placeholder for subclasses to implement specific behavior that occurs with each game tick. Therefore, there are no property changes to describe in relation to game ticks for this base class.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how the player can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts what actions can be performed with or on the container (e.g., placing objects inside it or taking objects from it).\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and contextually appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the isOpen property based on the conditions met.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the isOpen property based on the conditions met.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Attempts to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object to inside the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is not a liquid. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken (if successful), and a boolean flag. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object from inside the container to another location (e.g., the player's inventory).\n- makeDescriptionStr: Generates a human-readable description of the container, which can be detailed or brief depending on the makeDetailed flag. This method is important for providing players with information about the container and its state (e.g., open or closed, empty or containing items).\n\nThe Container class, by inheriting from GameObject, gains all the properties and methods of a GameObject, with additional properties and methods specific to containers. This allows for complex interactions in the game, such as opening, closing, placing objects in, and taking objects from containers, thereby enhancing the gameplay experience with realistic object interactions.==========\nObject: Water\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- isLiquid: Indicates that water is a liquid. This property is critical for interactions that depend on the state of matter, such as pouring or freezing.\n- volume: Represents the amount of water, which is a critical property for actions that involve measuring or transferring water between containers.\n\nThe `Water` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no changes to its properties at each game tick based on this code. The properties are straightforward, with `isLiquid` being a boolean that likely affects how the game physics or interactions with the water object are handled, and `volume` being a numerical value that could be used in various calculations or conditions, such as filling, spilling, or mixing with other substances.\n\nThe `getReferents` method provides a way to refer to the water object contextually, indicating its location (e.g., \"water in bucket\"), which enhances the text-based interaction by giving a clearer description of where the water is located within the game world.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method returns the name of the object, which is \"water\" in this case, providing a simple description for the water object when needed, without detailing its properties or state. This method could be used in listings or when a brief mention of the object is required in the game's narrative or descriptions.==========\nObject: Sink\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isActivatable: Indicates that a sink can be activated or turned on/off. This property allows the sink to change its state between active (on) and inactive (off), which affects its behavior during the game.\n- isOn: Represents whether the sink is currently turned on or off. This initial state can be set when the sink is created and can be toggled with the turnOn and turnOff methods. When the sink is on, it affects contained objects by adding water to them during each game tick.\n- water_out_per_tick: Specifies the amount of water (in some unit of volume) that the sink outputs per game tick when it is turned on. This property determines how much water is added to objects within the sink that can contain water.\n\nBehavior during game ticks:\n- When the sink is on, the tick method adds water to any object within the sink that is capable of containing water (indicated by the \"isWaterContainer\" property) and does not already contain water. If an object within the sink already contains water, the method increases the volume of water in the object by the amount specified in \"water_out_per_tick,\" up to the maximum volume that the object can hold. This behavior simulates filling containers with water over time while the sink is active.\n\nMethods for changing state:\n- turnOn: Attempts to turn the sink on. If the sink is already on or cannot be activated, it returns an error message and a success flag set to False. Otherwise, it sets the sink's \"isOn\" property to True and returns a success message and flag.\n- turnOff: Attempts to turn the sink off. Similar to turnOn, it checks if the sink can be deactivated and whether it is already off, returning appropriate messages and success flags. If the conditions are met, it sets the \"isOn\" property to False, effectively stopping the water flow.==========\nObject: Measuring Cup\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- isWaterContainer: Indicates that the measuring cup can contain water or other liquids, set to True.\n- liquid: A boolean indicating whether there is liquid in the measuring cup. Initially set to False, it changes based on whether liquid is added to or removed from the measuring cup.\n- volume: The total volume capacity of the measuring cup. This is a critical property as it determines how much liquid or how many objects the measuring cup can hold before it is considered full.\n\nBehavior and Property Changes:\n- When an object is added to the measuring cup using the `addObject` method, the method first calls the superclass's `addObject` to actually add the object to the measuring cup. If the added object is a liquid (`isLiquid` property is True), the measuring cup's `liquid` property is set to True if it wasn't already. The volume of the liquid in the measuring cup is then updated by adding the volume of the newly added liquid object.\n- If adding the object causes the total contained volume to exceed the measuring cup's capacity (`volume`), the method adjusts the volume of liquid in the measuring cup to ensure it does not exceed the cup's capacity. If the excess volume is greater than the volume of the liquid present, the liquid is removed, and the `liquid` property is set to False. Otherwise, the liquid's volume is reduced by the excess amount.\n- The `getContainedVolume` method calculates the total volume of all objects contained within the measuring cup, which is used to determine if the cup is overfilled when adding objects.\n- The `getLiquid` method returns the liquid object contained within the measuring cup if there is one. Since the game assumes there is only one type of liquid, this method does not account for multiple types of liquids.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the measuring cup, including its name, whether it contains any objects or liquid, and the total volume of contents if applicable. If detailed information is requested (`makeDetailed=True`), it lists all contained items by name.==========\nObject: Stone\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nvolume: the volume of the stone, indicating its size or space it occupies.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- The World class does not explicitly define any critical properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a room or a world within the game, capable of containing other objects.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the world or room, listing all objects it contains. This method enhances the interaction with the game by giving the player a detailed or a brief overview of their surroundings, depending on the `makeDetailed` flag. However, since there are no critical properties explicitly defined in the `__init__` method, and there is no `tick` method present, there are no dynamic property changes to describe over time for this class.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, there are no specific critical properties to explain based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class is designed to represent an agent (e.g., a player character or an NPC) within the game. It inherits from the `Container` class, which suggests that the agent can hold or contain other objects, similar to how a player might carry items in an inventory.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this method is used to refer to the agent object within the game's narrative or command parsing context.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is likely used to generate a textual description of the agent object. The `makeDetailed` parameter suggests that there could be a more detailed description available, but in this implementation, it does not alter the output.\n\nTick Method:\n- There is no `tick` method defined in this class, so there are no changes to the object's properties at each game tick based on this code snippet.==========\n",
    "bird-life-cycle": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or by other means.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. It includes mechanisms for handling unique identifiers (UUIDs), naming, containment (both holding other objects and being contained within another object), and property management. The class also outlines a basic structure for updating object states during game ticks, though the default implementation does nothing and is intended to be overridden by subclasses as needed.\n\nCritical methods and their functionalities include:\n- `getProperty`: Safely retrieves a property value of the object, returning `None` if the property does not exist. This method ensures that attempts to access undefined properties do not result in errors.\n- `addObject` and `removeObject`: These methods manage the containment relationship, allowing objects to be added to or removed from this object's \"contains\" list, effectively handling the object's capacity to function as a container.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer`: Allows the object to remove itself from its parent container, if any, ensuring that objects can manage their containment relationships dynamically.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive`: Recursively retrieves all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects, facilitating comprehensive searches or operations on the entire containment hierarchy.\n- `containsItemWithName`: Searches for and returns objects contained directly (non-recursively) within this object that match a specified name, useful for locating specific objects by name.\n- `tick`: A placeholder method for updating the object's state at each game tick, intended to be overridden with specific behavior by subclasses.\n- `getReferents`: Returns a list of names or identifiers by which the object can be referred, initially just the object's name but can be extended to include aliases or other identifiers.\n- `makeDescriptionStr`: Generates a human-readable description of the object, which can be detailed or brief depending on the `makeDetailed` flag. This method is crucial for providing textual representations of objects within the game.\n\nOverall, the `GameObject` class lays the groundwork for creating and managing objects within a text-based game, offering essential attributes and behaviors that can be extended or modified by more specific subclasses to create a rich and interactive game world.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container, which means it can hold other objects. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other items within the game world.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property because it directly impacts what actions can be performed with or on the container (e.g., placing items inside or taking them out).\n- containerPrefix: This property defines the preposition used to describe the location of items relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for items inside the container). It's critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the `isOpen` property based on the conditions met.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. Similar to `openContainer`, this method changes the `isOpen` property based on the action's success.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object to inside the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently inside the container. It returns a message, a reference to the object, and a success flag. This method impacts the game's state by changing the location of an object from inside the container to another location (or making it available to be placed elsewhere).\n\nThe `Container` class, through its properties and methods, defines an object that can hold other objects within the game. It allows for dynamic interaction with the game world, where players can manipulate objects by placing them into or taking them out of containers, provided the conditions defined by the object's properties are met.==========\nObject: Bird\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- stage: Indicates the life stage of the bird, which can be \"egg\", \"young bird\", or \"adult bird\". This property determines the behavior and status of the bird object within the game.\n- warm: Represents the warmth level of the egg. It is critical for the egg's survival and hatching process. A warm level of 0 implies the egg is dead.\n- food: Indicates the food level of a young bird. It is essential for the survival and growth of the bird. A food level of 0 or 1 indicates the bird is either dead or hungry, respectively.\n- hatch: Tracks the hatching progress of an egg. When it reaches a certain threshold (5 in this case), the egg hatches into a young bird, assuming it has maintained sufficient warmth.\n- grow: Tracks the growth progress of a young bird. When it reaches a certain threshold (5 in this case), the young bird matures into an adult bird, assuming it has been adequately fed.\n\nTick Method Behavior:\n- For an egg (`stage == \"egg\"`), it loses 1 point of warmth (`warm`) at each game tick. This simulates the need for warmth to sustain the egg. Additionally, the egg gains 1 point of hatch (`hatch`) at each tick, moving towards hatching into a young bird. If the hatch count reaches 5 and the egg has maintained more than 0 warmth, it transitions to the \"young bird\" stage, resetting its food level to 3, indicating it has been successfully hatched.\n- For a young bird (`stage == \"young bird\"`), it loses 1 point of food (`food`) at each game tick, simulating the need for regular feeding. The young bird also gains 1 point of growth (`grow`) at each tick, progressing towards becoming an adult bird. If the growth count reaches 5 and the bird has maintained more than 0 food, it transitions to the \"adult bird\" stage, indicating it has grown up.\n\nThis class models the life cycle of a bird in the game, from being an egg to becoming an adult, with critical survival factors such as warmth and food influencing its development and survival. The tick method updates these properties to simulate the passage of time and its effects on the bird's life stages.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a \"world\" concept within the game, specifically from the perspective of a mother bird in her nest. The critical aspect of this class is its role in containing other objects, which can be anything that the game might consider as part of this \"world\" or \"nest\" environment.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a narrative mechanism to describe the world from the mother bird's perspective, listing all contained objects with their descriptions. This method enhances the immersive experience by dynamically generating a description of the current state of the world (or nest) based on the objects it contains. However, since there's no `tick` method defined in this class, there's no description of how properties change over time with each game tick.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Bird\n\nProperties:\n- There are no explicitly commented critical properties within the `__init__` method for this class. However, by inheriting from Bird, the Agent class likely inherits properties and behaviors specific to birds, such as the ability to fly or specific bird-related actions, adjusted to fit the context of an \"agent\" within the game. Since the class is designed to represent the player or an NPC as an agent with bird-like characteristics, it does not define new properties but relies on the inherited properties and methods from both GameObject and Bird classes.\n\nThe `getReferents` method:\n- This method returns a list containing a single string \"yourself\". This suggests that in the context of the game, when referring to this object, it is recognized as the player or an NPC itself. This could be used in the game's narrative or command parsing to identify actions or descriptions that refer back to the player or the NPC represented by this Agent object.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method:\n- This method, when called, simply returns the string \"yourself\", regardless of whether the `makeDetailed` flag is set to True or False. This indicates that the description of the Agent object is fixed and does not change based on context or detail level requested. It reinforces the idea that this object represents the player or an NPC in a very direct and personal way, focusing on the self-identification aspect within the game's narrative or descriptions.\n\nNo `tick` method function is defined in the provided class definition, so there is no behavior or property change at each game tick explicitly defined for the Agent object. Any dynamic behavior or property changes would depend on methods inherited from the Bird class or further implementation outside of what is provided.==========\n",
    "scale-weigh": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class and does not inherit from any other class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, which means they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless specified otherwise, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or by other means within the game environment.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the text game. It provides basic functionalities such as tracking the object's unique identifier (`uuid`), name, and its relationship with other objects (e.g., containment hierarchy). The class also establishes a property dictionary (`properties`) where specific attributes related to the object can be stored and accessed.\n\nCritical methods include:\n- `getProperty`: Safely retrieves a property value by name, returning `None` if the property does not exist. This method ensures that attempts to access undefined properties do not result in errors.\n- `addObject` and `removeObject`: These methods manage the containment relationship between objects. `addObject` allows an object to be added to the current object's containment list (`contains`), effectively making the current object a container if it wasn't one already. Conversely, `removeObject` removes an object from the containment list. Both methods automatically update the `parentContainer` attribute of the object being added or removed, maintaining the integrity of the containment hierarchy.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer`: Allows an object to remove itself from its parent container, if any. This method is useful for dynamically changing the game's object hierarchy, such as when an object is picked up by the player.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive` and `containsItemWithName`: These methods facilitate the retrieval of objects contained within the current object, either by listing all contained objects (including those nested within other contained objects) or by searching for objects with a specific name.\n- `tick`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden in subclasses. It is designed to implement any updates or actions that need to occur at each game tick, allowing for dynamic behavior over time.\n- `getReferents`: Returns a list of names or identifiers by which the object can be referred, facilitating object identification within the game.\n- `makeDescriptionStr`: Generates a human-readable description of the object. This method can be customized in subclasses to provide more detailed or context-specific descriptions.\n\nOverall, the `GameObject` class provides essential infrastructure for creating and managing objects within the text game, offering a flexible framework for defining object behaviors and interactions.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to place or take objects).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the contents within the container. If a container is closed, players may not be able to place objects inside it or take objects from it without first opening the container.\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for objects inside the container). This property is critical for generating descriptive text about where objects are located in the game world, enhancing the game's narrative and spatial understanding.\n\nMethods and Their Effects on Properties:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method directly modifies the `isOpen` property by setting it to True if the container is successfully opened, thereby changing how players can interact with the container and its contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This method directly modifies the `isOpen` property by setting it to False if the container is successfully closed, affecting the accessibility of the container's contents.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Attempts to place an object inside the container if the container is a container, is open, and the object is moveable. This method impacts the game's state by potentially changing the location of an object, moving it into the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is a container, is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently inside the container. This method affects the game's state by potentially changing the location of an object, removing it from the container.\n\nThe `Container` class, through its properties and methods, plays a crucial role in the game's mechanics related to object storage, retrieval, and interaction. It defines a generic container object that can be extended or used as-is to create various interactable objects in the game world, such as boxes, chests, or drawers, each with its own rules for accessibility and interaction based on the properties defined in this class.==========\nObject: TestObject\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nweight: the weight of the object, which is a critical property set during initialization.\n\nThe `TestObject` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick. The critical property here is `weight`, which is set when an instance of `TestObject` is created. This property likely affects how the object can be interacted with in the game, such as whether it can be picked up or moved by the player or another object.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the object, which includes a determination of whether to use \"a\" or \"an\" based on the first letter of the object's name, making the description grammatically correct depending on whether the name starts with a vowel or a consonant. This method does not affect any properties but provides a way to describe the object within the game.==========\nObject: Scale\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isMoveable: This property indicates that the scale cannot be moved within the game. This could be due to its role in the game as a stationary object for weighing items, or perhaps to simplify the gameplay mechanics.\n- containerPrefix: The prefix \"on\" is used to describe how items are placed in relation to the scale, i.e., items are placed \"on\" the scale to be weighed. This is a natural choice of preposition, reflecting the real-world interaction with a scale.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method dynamically generates a description of the scale based on its current state:\n- If the scale is empty (contains no items), it simply returns a string indicating that the scale reads \"0g\", implying that nothing is being weighed.\n- If the scale contains one or more items, it calculates the total weight of all items on the scale and constructs a detailed description that includes the total weight reading and a list of the items on the scale. This description is particularly useful for providing players with feedback on the result of their actions (e.g., placing items on the scale) and for creating a more immersive and interactive game environment.\n\nThe method for generating the detailed description is careful to use proper grammar, including the use of \"and\" before the last item in a list if there are multiple items, which enhances the readability and naturalness of the text presented to the player. This attention to detail in the description contributes to a more polished and engaging game experience.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties: None specified directly in the `__init__` method.\n\nThe `World` class does not explicitly define any new properties in its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `Container` class. It is initialized with a type of \"room\", indicating that instances of `World` are considered to be rooms or containers for other objects within the game's context. The critical properties of the `World` object would be those inherited from the `Container` class, which are not directly visible in the provided code snippet but typically include properties related to containing other objects, such as a list of contained objects and methods for adding or removing objects.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the `World` object, which includes a detailed or non-detailed listing of all objects contained within it. This method starts with a base description indicating the player finds themselves in a room and then iterates through all objects contained within the `World` (room) to append their descriptions to the output string. If `makeDetailed` is `True`, it could potentially alter how the contained objects' descriptions are generated, although the specifics of how detailed descriptions are generated would depend on the implementation of `makeDescriptionStr` in the contained objects themselves.\n\nSince there is no `tick` method defined in the `World` class, there is no behavior specified for how the properties of the `World` object or its contained objects might change at each game tick.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no critical properties commented within the `__init__` function to explain.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class represents an entity in the game that can contain other objects, as indicated by its inheritance from the `Container` class. This suggests that the agent can carry or hold items within the game.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, which implies that this class is intended to represent the player or an NPC (Non-Player Character) as themselves within the game world. This method could be used to identify the agent in text commands or descriptions.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that the description of the agent is not detailed and is fixed to a singular perspective. This method might be used to generate text for the game's narrative or descriptions, focusing on the agent's role as the player or a specific character within the game context.\n\nSince there is no `tick` method defined in the provided class, there's no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.==========\n",
    "cooking": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or through other game mechanics.\n\nMethods:\n- `getProperty(propertyName)`: Safely retrieves a property of the object, returning `None` if the property doesn't exist. This method ensures that accessing a property that has not been set will not cause an error.\n- `addObject(obj)`: Adds an object to this container (if it is a container), removing it from its previous container. This method manages the containment hierarchy within the game, ensuring objects are correctly parented.\n- `removeObject(obj)`: Removes an object from this container. It is used to manage the contents of containers within the game, ensuring that the object list remains accurate when items are moved or taken.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer()`: Removes the current object from whatever container it's currently in. This method allows an object to be disassociated from its parent container, useful for moving objects around in the game world.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive()`: Retrieves all objects contained within this object, recursively. This method is useful for getting a complete list of all items within a container and any sub-containers it may have.\n- `containsItemWithName(name)`: Checks if this object (non-recursively) contains an item with the specified name. This method is useful for searching for specific items within a container without examining nested containers.\n- `tick()`: A placeholder for performing any internal updates that need to be performed at each step of the game. This method is meant to be overridden by subclasses that need to update their state as the game progresses.\n- `getReferents()`: Returns a list of names (referents) that this object can be called by. This method is useful for identifying objects within the game world, allowing for a flexible naming system.\n- `makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False)`: Generates a human-readable string that describes this object. This method provides a way to present object information to the player, with an optional detailed description for more in-depth information.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects in the game, providing basic properties and methods for managing containment, movement, and description. It is designed to be extended by other classes to create more specific types of objects within the game world.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to place or take objects).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is critical for gameplay as it dictates whether objects can be placed in or taken out of the container.\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and understandable descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the isOpen property based on the conditions met.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the isOpen property based on the conditions met.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Attempts to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game state by potentially adding an object to the container's contents.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is moveable and contained within. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag and a reference to the object being taken. This method affects the game state by potentially removing an object from the container's contents.\n\nThe Container class, by inheriting from GameObject, gains all the properties and methods of a GameObject, with additional properties and methods specific to containers. These properties and methods enable complex interactions with the container objects in the game, such as opening, closing, placing objects inside, and taking objects out, thereby enhancing the gameplay experience with realistic object interactions.==========\nObject: CookBook\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- receipt: This property is a dictionary that maps ingredient names to their preparation methods. The key is the name of the ingredient, and the value is a list of tuples, each tuple representing a pair of preparation methods (cut methods, cook methods) for that ingredient. This structure allows the cookbook to store complex recipes that require multiple steps to prepare each ingredient.\n\nThe `read` method constructs and returns a string that outlines the recipe contained within the cookbook. It starts with a header instructing the reader to gather all ingredients and follow the directions. It then lists all the ingredients required for the recipe. Following the ingredient list, it provides directions for preparing each ingredient according to the methods specified in the `receipt` property. Each ingredient's preparation methods are listed, instructing the reader to apply the specified cut and cook methods to the ingredient. Finally, it concludes with a step to prepare the meal, indicating that all previous steps should lead to the assembly or cooking of the final dish.\n\nThis class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.==========\nObject: Ingredient\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- cut: Describes how the ingredient is cut, if at all. This property is initially set to None, indicating that the ingredient has not been cut. When modified, it likely stores information about the type of cut applied to the ingredient, which affects its description.\n- cook: Specifies how the ingredient is cooked, if applicable. This property is also initially None, suggesting that the ingredient is raw or uncooked to start with. Once changed, it probably holds details on the cooking method or state of the ingredient, influencing its description.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method constructs a string that describes the ingredient, incorporating its cut and cook states if they have been defined. This method dynamically adjusts the description based on the ingredient's properties, providing a detailed narrative element to the game by reflecting the changes in the ingredient's preparation state.==========\nObject: Device\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- cook_method: This property defines the method of cooking that the device uses, represented as a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the verb (e.g., \"roast\") describing the action of cooking, and the second element is the adjective (e.g., \"roasted\") describing the state of the ingredient after being cooked.\n\nThe `cook` method in the `Device` class takes an ingredient as an argument. It checks if the ingredient has already been cooked by looking for a \"cook\" property. If the ingredient has already been cooked, it returns a message stating that the ingredient has already been cooked. If the ingredient has not been cooked, it sets the ingredient's \"cook\" property to the device's cooking method (stored in `self.properties[\"cook_method\"]`) and returns a message indicating that the ingredient has been cooked using the specified method in the device. This interaction changes the state of the ingredient by marking it as cooked according to the device's cooking method.==========\nObject: Knife\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- No critical properties explicitly defined in the `__init__` method.\n\nThe `Knife` class is a simple subclass of `GameObject` and does not introduce new properties in its initialization method. However, it has a specific functionality defined by the `cut` method. This method allows the `Knife` to interact with an `ingredient` object by modifying the `ingredient`'s properties based on whether it has been cut or not.\n\nThe `cut` method takes two parameters: `ingredient`, which is the object being cut, and `cut_method`, which is a tuple containing information about how the ingredient is cut. The method first checks if the `ingredient` has a `cut` property that is not `None`. If the `ingredient` has already been cut (i.e., the `cut` property is not `None`), it returns a message indicating that the `ingredient` has already been cut in a specific way, using the second element of the `cut` tuple stored in the `ingredient`'s `cut` property.\n\nIf the `ingredient` has not been cut yet (i.e., the `cut` property is `None`), the method assigns the `cut_method` tuple to the `ingredient`'s `cut` property. This action effectively marks the `ingredient` as having been cut in a specific manner. The method then returns a message indicating that the player has successfully cut the `ingredient` using the method described by the first element of the `cut_method` tuple.\n\nThis class and its method demonstrate how objects in the game can interact with each other, changing their states (properties) based on actions performed by the player or other objects. The `Knife` class specifically provides functionality related to preparing ingredients, which could be a part of a larger set of actions in a cooking or crafting system within the game.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties: None specified as critical within the `__init__` method.\n\nThe `World` class does not explicitly define any new properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `Container` class. It is initialized with a name (\"kitchen\"), which is passed to the `Container` class it inherits from. This suggests that the `World` object is intended to represent a container for other objects, specifically within the context of a kitchen in this case. The primary role of this class seems to be to organize and contain other objects that would logically be found in a kitchen setting within the game.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a way to generate a descriptive string about the `World` object, which in this context is the kitchen. When called, it starts with a base description indicating the player is in a kitchen and then iterates over all objects contained within this `World` object (the kitchen), appending their descriptions to the output string. This method supports an optional `makeDetailed` argument, but it does not alter the behavior in this implementation, as the detailed descriptions are handled by the `makeDescriptionStr` methods of the contained objects themselves, not by the `World` class directly.\n\nThere is no `tick` method defined in the `World` class, so there is no behavior described for how the properties of the `World` object or its contained objects might change over time or with game ticks. This class serves primarily as a static container and organizational tool for the game's structure, specifically for arranging the game's objects within the context of a kitchen environment.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, there are no specific critical properties to explain based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class is designed to represent an agent (likely the player or an NPC) within the game. It inherits from `Container`, suggesting that the agent can hold or contain other objects, similar to how a player might carry items in an inventory.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this method is used to refer to the agent within the game's narrative or command parsing context. This could be useful for commands or descriptions that involve the player directly.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is likely used to generate a description of the agent when needed for the game's narrative or user interface. The `makeDetailed` parameter is present but not used in the method, suggesting that, in this implementation, the detail level of the description does not alter its output.\n\nSince there is no `tick` method defined in the provided class, there is no behavior to describe regarding how the object's properties might change at each game tick.==========\n",
    "lit-lightbulb": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or through other game mechanics.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. It includes mechanisms for tracking the object's unique identifier (`uuid`), name, containment relationships (`parentContainer` and `contains` list), and a generic properties dictionary (`properties`) for additional attributes.\n\nCritical methods include:\n- `getProperty`: Safely retrieves a property value by name, returning `None` if the property does not exist. This method ensures that attempts to access undefined properties do not result in errors.\n- `addObject` and `removeObject`: Manage the containment relationship between objects. `addObject` allows an object to be placed within another (assuming the container property allows for it), while `removeObject` facilitates the removal of an object from its container.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer`: Allows an object to remove itself from its current container, adjusting the containment hierarchy accordingly.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive`: Recursively retrieves all objects contained within the current object, including those nested within other contained objects.\n- `containsItemWithName`: Searches for and returns objects contained directly within the current object that match a specified name. This search is not recursive and only considers the immediate contents of the object.\n- `tick`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden in derived classes to implement behavior that occurs at each game tick. By default, it performs no action.\n- `getReferents`: Returns a list of names or identifiers by which the object can be referred. By default, this includes the object's name.\n- `makeDescriptionStr`: Generates a human-readable description of the object. By default, it returns the object's name, but it can be overridden in derived classes to provide more detailed descriptions.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not inherently change any properties at each game tick since the `tick` method is implemented as a pass-through. However, derived classes can override this method to update properties or perform actions periodically.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how the player can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to place or take objects).\n- isOpen: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the contents within the container. If a container is closed, the player may not be able to access its contents without first opening it.\n- containerPrefix: This property defines how the container is referred to in relation to contained objects (e.g., \"in\" for a box where objects are inside it). It's critical for generating descriptive text that accurately reflects the spatial relationship between the container and its contents.\n\nMethods and Their Effects on Properties:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method directly modifies the `isOpen` property by setting it to True if the container is successfully opened, thereby changing how the player can interact with the container's contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This method directly modifies the `isOpen` property by setting it to False if the container is successfully closed, affecting the player's access to the contents.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Allows placing an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method affects the game's state by potentially adding objects to the container's contents, thereby changing the container's interaction possibilities.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Allows removing an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is indeed inside the container. This method affects the game's state by potentially removing objects from the container's contents, altering how the container is interacted with and what it contains.\n\nThe `Container` class, through its properties and methods, defines a versatile object type in the game that can hold other objects, with various conditions for access and manipulation based on its state (open or closed) and the properties of the objects it might contain (moveable or not). This functionality is essential for creating a dynamic and interactive game environment where objects can be stored, retrieved, and used in different ways.==========\nObject: ElectricalObject\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- is_electrical_object: This property indicates that the object is an electrical object within the game. It is set to True to signify its nature as part of the electrical system or network within the game environment.\n- conductive: This property determines whether the electrical object can conduct electricity. It is a critical property because it affects how the object interacts with other electrical objects and the game's electrical system. If set to True, the object can conduct electricity, allowing for electrical connections and interactions with other objects.\n- connects: This property represents the electrical connections of the object. It is a dictionary with two keys, \"terminal1\" and \"terminal2\", each associated with a tuple. The tuple contains two elements: the first element is either None or a reference to another electrical object that this object is connected to, and the second element is also either None or a string representing the terminal of the connected object. This property is critical for defining how the object is integrated into the game's electrical network and how it interacts with other electrical objects.\n\nThe `disconnect` method allows for the disconnection of this electrical object from another by setting the corresponding terminal's connection to `(None, None)` in both the `connects` dictionary of this object and the `properties['connects']` dictionary. This action effectively removes the electrical connection between the two objects, which could alter the behavior of the game's electrical system depending on how connections are utilized within the game logic.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the electrical object, detailing its name and its connections. The description varies depending on whether the object is connected to other objects and how many connections it has. This method provides a dynamic way to describe the object's current state in terms of its electrical connections, enhancing the game's narrative or informational feedback to the player.==========\nObject: Battery\nInherits: ElectricalObject\nProperties:\nconnects: This property represents the connections for the cathode and anode of the battery. Each key ('cathode' and 'anode') maps to a tuple, initially set to (None, None). This likely indicates that the battery can be connected to other electrical components via its cathode and anode, but starts off not connected to anything. The tuple structure might be used to store information about what the cathode and anode are connected to, possibly including the object they are connected to and the type of connection.==========\nObject: LightBulb\nInherits: ElectricalObject\nProperties:\n- on: Indicates whether the light bulb is on or off.\n\nThe `LightBulb` class inherits from `ElectricalObject`, which suggests it is designed to function within an electrical system, likely with properties and methods related to electrical connectivity and operation.\n\nCritical Property Explained:\n- The `on` property is a boolean that represents whether the light bulb is currently powered on (`True`) or off (`False`). This property is critical for simulating the light bulb's functionality within the game, as it directly affects the light bulb's state and potentially the game environment (e.g., visibility in a room).\n\nThe `connectsToBattery` method is designed to check if the light bulb is part of a conductive circuit that includes at least one battery. This method iterates through connected objects starting from the light bulb itself, checking for conductivity and the presence of a battery in the circuit. The method returns `True` if a conductive path to a battery is found, indicating that the light bulb can be powered on, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe `tick` method is called at each game tick and determines whether the light bulb should be turned on or off based on its connectivity to a battery, as determined by the `connectsToBattery` method. If the light bulb is connected to a battery through a conductive path, the `on` property is set to `True`, turning the light bulb on. If there is no conductive path to a battery, the `on` property is set to `False`, turning the light bulb off. This dynamic adjustment allows the light bulb's state to change in response to modifications in the game environment, such as changes in the circuit configuration.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a descriptive string for the light bulb, indicating its current state (on or off) and its connections to other objects. This method provides a textual representation of the light bulb's status and connectivity, which can be used to inform the player about the state of electrical objects within the game environment.==========\nObject: Wire\nInherits: ElectricalObject\nProperties:\n- is_wire: This property indicates that the object is a wire, which is a critical identifier within the game's logic. It likely affects how the object interacts with other electrical objects or systems within the game environment. Since there's no `tick` method provided in the given class definition, there's no description of how its properties change over time with each game tick.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- The World class does not explicitly define any critical properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a room or a world within the game, capable of containing other objects. The critical aspect of this class lies in its ability to aggregate and describe the objects it contains, rather than in specific, individual properties.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual representation of the world and the objects within it. When called, it generates a string that describes the room and lists the objects contained within. This method supports both a simple and a detailed description, depending on the `makeDetailed` flag, although the provided code snippet does not alter its behavior based on this flag; it always lists the objects in the room. This method enhances the game's interactivity by allowing players to visualize the environment and the items around them, contributing to the immersive experience of the game.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method as per the given instructions. However, by inheriting from `Container`, it implicitly has properties related to containing other objects, such as a list of objects it contains (`self.contains`). This suggests that the agent can carry or hold other objects within the game.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this object refers to the player or an NPC (Non-Player Character) within the game. This method could be used in the game's text parsing system to identify commands directed towards the player's character or an NPC.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This suggests that when the game needs to describe this object (likely representing the player or an NPC), it will simply refer to it as \"yourself\". This could be part of the game's narrative or text output system, providing a way to refer to the agent in a manner that is consistent with the game's perspective (first-person, second-person, etc.).\n- Since there is no `tick` method defined in this class, there are no properties that change at each game tick as per the instructions given.==========\n",
    "make-ice-cubes": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or other game mechanics.\n- temperature: Sets the initial temperature of the object to 20 degrees Celsius. This property implies that objects in the game can have a temperature attribute, which could be relevant for game mechanics involving heat or cold.\n\nMethods:\n- getProperty(propertyName): Safely retrieves a property of the object, returning None if the property doesn't exist. This method allows for the safe interaction with object properties, ensuring that attempts to access non-existent properties do not result in errors.\n- addObject(obj): Adds an object to this container (if it is a container), removing it from its previous container. This method facilitates the dynamic interaction between objects, allowing them to be moved from one container to another.\n- removeObject(obj): Removes an object from this container. This method is essential for managing the contents of container objects, allowing for the removal of items.\n- removeSelfFromContainer(): Removes the current object from whatever container it's currently in. This method allows an object to be disassociated from its parent container, making it independent or ready to be added to another container.\n- getAllContainedObjectsRecursive(): Retrieves all objects contained within this object, recursively. This method is useful for getting a comprehensive list of all items within a container and any sub-containers, enabling deep searches through object hierarchies.\n- containsItemWithName(name): Checks if the container directly contains an object with the specified name (not recursively). This method allows for the identification of specific items within a container based on their name.\n- tick(): A placeholder method intended to be overridden in subclasses to perform any internal updates that need to be performed at each step of the game. This method suggests a mechanism for objects to change state or trigger actions over time, aligning with the concept of game \"ticks\" or time steps.\n- getReferents(): Returns a list of names (referents) that this object can be called by. This method facilitates the identification and interaction with objects based on their names or identifiers.\n- makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False): Generates a human-readable string that describes this object. This method is crucial for providing textual descriptions of objects, which can be displayed to the player to convey information about the object's state, contents, or other attributes.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the contents within the container. If a container is closed, players may not be able to place or take objects from it without opening it first.\n- containerPrefix: Defines the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and contextually appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to True if successful, allowing access to the container's contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to False if successful, restricting access to the container's contents.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Attempts to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method affects the game state by changing the location of an object to within the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently inside the container. This method changes the game state by altering the location of an object, effectively removing it from the container.\n- makeDescriptionStr: Generates a human-readable description of the container, which can be used to provide players with information about the container and its state (e.g., open or closed, empty or containing items).\n\nThe Container class, by defining these properties and methods, plays a crucial role in the game's object management system, allowing for complex interactions with objects that can contain other objects, thereby enriching the gameplay experience with a layer of realism and interactivity.==========\nObject: Device\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isDevice: Indicates that the object is a device. This property is set to True, meaning every instance of this class or its subclasses is considered a device within the game context.\n- isActivatable: Determines whether the device can be turned on or off. This is set to True by default, suggesting that devices are expected to have an active state that can be toggled by the player or game events.\n- isOn: Tracks the current state of the device, whether it is on or off. Initially set to False, indicating that devices start in the off state unless otherwise specified.\n\nMethods:\n- turnOn(): Attempts to turn the device on. If the device is not activatable or is already on, it returns an error message and a success flag set to False. Otherwise, it sets `isOn` to True and returns a success message with a success flag set to True.\n- turnOff(): Attempts to turn the device off. Similar to `turnOn()`, but for turning the device off. If the device is not activatable or is already off, it returns an error message and a success flag set to False. Otherwise, it sets `isOn` to False and returns a success message with a success flag set to True.\n- useWithObject(patientObject): Provides a mechanism to attempt using the device with another object, referred to as `patientObject`. By default, it returns a message indicating uncertainty about how to use the device with the specified object, along with a success flag set to False. This method can be overridden in subclasses to implement specific interactions.\n- makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False): Generates a human-readable description of the device, including its name and whether it is currently on or off. The `makeDetailed` parameter is available but not used in the base implementation, allowing for future extension where a more detailed description might be needed.\n\nThe `Device` class provides a foundational representation of activatable devices within the game, offering basic functionality for toggling their state and interacting with other objects. It is designed to be extended by more specific device types that can provide additional functionality and interactions.==========\nObject: Freezer\nInherits: Container, Device\nProperties:\n- minTemperature: This is the minimum temperature that the freezer can reach, set at -4.0 degrees Celsius. It represents the lowest temperature setting available for the freezer, ensuring that items within are kept frozen.\n- tempDecreasePerTick: This property indicates how much the temperature inside the freezer decreases per game tick, set at 5.0 degrees Celsius. This simulates the cooling effect of the freezer on its contents over time.\n\nThe `tick` method in the Freezer class is designed to simulate the ongoing process of cooling items stored inside the freezer. At each game tick, if the freezer is on and closed (`isOn` is True and `isOpen` is False), the temperature of each item inside the freezer is decreased by the value specified in `tempDecreasePerTick`, but not below the `minTemperature`. This ensures that items do not freeze beyond the freezer's capability to cool, reflecting a realistic behavior of a freezer in maintaining its internal temperature and affecting the items stored within.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the freezer, including its state (open or closed), and if detailed information is requested, a list of items contained within. This method enhances the game's interactivity by allowing players to visualize the state and contents of the freezer, contributing to a more immersive experience.==========\nObject: IceCubeTray\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isOpenable: Indicates that an ice cube tray cannot be opened. This property is critical because it defines the interaction capabilities of the object within the game. Since it is set to False, players cannot open the ice cube tray, which might affect how they use or interact with it in the game environment.\n\nThe `IceCubeTray` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no properties that change at each game tick to describe.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a way to generate a textual description of the ice cube tray, including its contents if any. This method dynamically constructs a description based on whether the tray contains any items. If it does, it lists these items, otherwise, it simply states that the tray is empty. This method enhances the interactive and immersive experience of the game by providing detailed descriptions of objects and their states, which can be crucial for gameplay, especially in text-based games where visual cues are absent.==========\nObject: Substance\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- solidName: The name of the substance when it is in its solid state.\n- liquidName: The name of the substance when it is in its liquid state.\n- gasName: The name of the substance when it is in its gaseous state.\n- boilingPoint: The temperature at which the substance transitions from a liquid to a gas.\n- meltingPoint: The temperature at which the substance transitions from a solid to a liquid.\n- temperature: The current temperature of the substance in degrees Celsius.\n\nThe `Substance` class represents a substance that can exist in three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. The state of the substance is determined by its current temperature relative to its melting and boiling points. The `tick` method updates the state of the substance (and its name) based on its current temperature. Here's how the properties change at each game tick:\n\n- If the temperature is less than or equal to the melting point, the substance is considered a solid, and its name is set to `solidName`.\n- If the temperature is above the melting point but less than or equal to the boiling point, the substance is considered a liquid, and its name is set to `liquidName`.\n- If the temperature is above the boiling point, the substance is considered a gas, and its name is set to `gasName`.\n\nThis dynamic change in the substance's state and name based on temperature allows for interactive and realistic simulation of substances within the game environment.==========\nObject: Water\nInherits: Substance\n\nProperties:\n- stateOfMatter: the current state of the water (ice, water, or steam), which is determined by its temperature.\n- freezingPoint: the temperature at which the water freezes (0 degrees Celsius).\n- boilingPoint: the temperature at which the water boils (100 degrees Celsius).\n- temperature: the current temperature of the water, which affects its state of matter.\n- tempIncreasePerTick: the amount by which the water's temperature increases per game tick (20 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe `Water` class inherits from the `Substance` class and is initialized with specific parameters to represent water. These parameters include the names for its different states of matter (\"ice\" for solid, \"water\" for liquid, and \"steam\" for gas), its freezing point (0 degrees Celsius), boiling point (100 degrees Celsius), and a temperature increase per tick of 20 degrees Celsius. Upon initialization, the `tick` method is called to set the initial state of matter based on its starting temperature.\n\nThe `tick` method, inherited from the `Substance` class and not explicitly defined in the `Water` class code snippet provided, likely adjusts the water's temperature each game tick according to the `tempIncreasePerTick` value. It then updates the `stateOfMatter` property based on the new temperature. If the temperature is below the freezing point, the state would be set to \"ice\". If the temperature is above the boiling point, the state would be set to \"steam\". Otherwise, the state remains as \"water\". This dynamic adjustment allows the water's state of matter to change in response to temperature changes throughout the game.==========\nObject: Sink\nInherits: Container, Device\n\nProperties:\n- **containerPrefix**: Indicates the preposition used to describe where the items are in relation to the sink, which is \"in\". This is critical for generating descriptions of the sink's contents in a way that makes sense spatially.\n- **isOpenable**: This property is set to False, indicating that a sink cannot be opened or closed like some other containers or devices might be. This affects how players can interact with the sink in the game, limiting actions to those that do not involve opening it.\n- **isMoveable**: Also set to False, suggesting that the sink is a fixed object within the game environment. Players cannot move the sink, which is typical for such a fixture in real-life scenarios.\n\nTick Method:\n- The `tick` method describes what happens during each game tick when the sink is turned on. Specifically, it adds water to any object within the sink that does not already have water on it. This simulates filling objects with water, reflecting a realistic interaction with a sink when it is on. The method checks each contained object to see if it is a container and, if so, whether it already contains an item named \"water\". If not, it adds a `Water` object to the container. This dynamic behavior allows for the game environment to change over time, specifically in response to the player's actions of turning the sink on or off and placing objects within it.==========\nObject: Pot\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isOpenable: Indicates that a pot cannot be opened. This property is critical because it defines the interaction capabilities with the pot. Since it's set to False, it means players or other objects cannot open the pot to access its contents in the same way they might with other containers that can be opened. This could affect gameplay mechanics, such as cooking or storing items, by limiting how the pot can be used in the game environment.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method dynamically generates a description of the pot based on its contents and whether it is empty or contains items. This method enhances the game's interactivity by providing players with detailed feedback about the state of the pot, including what items are inside it, if any. The description changes based on the contents of the pot, making the game environment more immersive and responsive to player actions.==========\nObject: Food\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nisFood: Indicates that the object is food, which could be relevant for interactions where only food items are applicable or required, such as eating or cooking processes.\n\nThe `Food` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. The critical aspect of this class is its role as a container for other objects, implying it can hold multiple objects within it, similar to how a kitchen can contain various items.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the World object, in this case, a kitchen, and lists all contained objects with their descriptions. This method enhances the interaction with the game by providing a detailed or a brief overview of the objects within the World (kitchen), depending on the `makeDetailed` flag. However, there are no properties that change over time as there is no `tick` method defined in this class, meaning the state of the World object remains static unless externally modified by game actions.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no critical properties commented within the `__init__` function to explain. \n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class represents an entity in the game that can contain other objects, as indicated by its inheritance from the `Container` class. This suggests that the agent can carry or hold items within the game.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, which implies that this class is used to represent the player or an NPC (Non-Player Character) as themselves within the game world.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that the description of this object (or agent) in the game is self-referential. This method's behavior does not change based on the `makeDetailed` flag, suggesting a static description for this object.\n- Since there is no `tick` method defined within this class, there are no properties that change at each game tick as per the instructions.==========\n",
    "plant-tree": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or game mechanics.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. It includes mechanisms for handling unique identifiers (UUIDs), naming, containment relationships (both holding other objects and being contained within another object), and property management. The class also outlines a structure for updating object states during game ticks, though the base implementation does not modify any properties. This allows derived classes to implement specific behaviors that occur at each game tick.\n\nCritical methods include:\n- `getProperty`: Safely retrieves a property value by name, returning `None` if the property does not exist. This method ensures that attempts to access undefined properties do not result in errors.\n- `addObject` and `removeObject`: Manage the containment relationship, allowing objects to be added to or removed from this object's `contains` list. These methods automatically update the `parentContainer` property of the object being added or removed, maintaining the integrity of the containment hierarchy.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer`: Allows an object to remove itself from its current container, if any. This method is useful for reorganizing objects within the game's spatial hierarchy.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive`: Recursively retrieves all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects. This method is useful for operations that need to consider an object and all of its contents, regardless of the depth of nesting.\n- `containsItemWithName`: Searches for objects with a specific name directly contained within this object (non-recursively), returning a list of found objects. This method is useful for locating objects by name without considering the entire containment hierarchy.\n- `tick`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden by derived classes to implement object-specific behavior that occurs at each game tick. The base implementation does nothing, reflecting the class's role as a generic object template.\n- `getReferents`: Returns a list of names (referents) by which the object can be identified. By default, this includes the object's name, but derived classes can override this method to provide additional or alternative referents.\n- `makeDescriptionStr`: Generates a human-readable description of the object. The base implementation simply returns the object's name, but derived classes can override this method to provide more detailed descriptions, optionally varying the level of detail based on the `makeDetailed` parameter.\n\nThe `GameObject` class is designed to be extended by more specific object classes that define particular types of objects within the game, allowing for a rich and interactive game environment.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts what actions can be performed with or on the container (e.g., placing objects inside it or taking objects from it).\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure and a boolean flag representing the outcome. This method directly modifies the isOpen property.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure and a boolean flag representing the outcome. This method directly modifies the isOpen property.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Attempts to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure and a boolean flag representing the outcome. This method affects the contents of the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently inside the container. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken (if successful), and a boolean flag representing the outcome. This method affects the contents of the container.\n- makeDescriptionStr: Generates a human-readable description of the container, which can be detailed or brief depending on the argument provided. This method does not modify any properties but presents the state of the object to the player.\n\nThe Container class, through its properties and methods, provides a framework for creating objects in the game that can hold other objects. The ability to open and close containers, along with the capacity to add or remove items, adds a layer of interaction and realism to the game environment.==========\nObject: Hole\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isMoveable: Indicates that the hole is not moveable. This property is critical as it defines the nature of the hole in the game environment, suggesting that once created or placed, the hole remains in its designated location and cannot be moved by the player or other game mechanics.\n\nThe `Hole` class does not contain a `tick` method, which means there are no properties that change at each game tick for this object. The absence of a `tick` method suggests that the hole's state or properties remain constant over time unless directly modified by game events or player actions.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a dynamic description of the hole, which changes based on its contents. If the hole contains one or more objects, it lists these objects in its description. If the hole is empty, it simply states that it is empty. This method enhances the interactive and immersive experience of the game by providing detailed feedback to the player based on their actions and the current state of the game environment.==========\nObject: Water\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties: None specified directly in the `__init__` method.\n\nThe `Water` class does not define any critical properties directly within its `__init__` method, as it only calls the constructor of its superclass, `GameObject`, with the argument `\"water\"`. This indicates that the `Water` object is primarily identified by its type or name within the game, without additional properties being set at initialization beyond what is inherited from `GameObject`.\n\nThe `Water` class, however, implements two methods that are worth noting:\n\n1. **`getReferents`**: This method returns a list containing a string that describes the water in relation to its container. The string is formatted as `\"water in {self.parentContainer.name}\"`, which dynamically references the name of the container holding the water. This method enhances the interaction with the water object by providing a contextual reference to its location within the game world.\n\n2. **`makeDescriptionStr`**: This method returns a simple string description of the object, which is just `\"water\"`. The `makeDetailed` parameter is accepted but not used in the method, indicating that the description of the water object remains the same regardless of the level of detail requested. This method is essential for generating textual representations of the water object for the player, but it does not modify or rely on any specific properties of the water object beyond its basic identification as water.\n\nIn summary, the `Water` class is a straightforward extension of the `GameObject` class, primarily identified by its name with additional methods to provide contextual information about its location and a basic description. There are no critical properties or a `tick` method defined in this class that would alter the object's state over time or in response to game events.==========\nObject: Sink\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isActivatable: Indicates that a sink can be activated or turned on. This property allows the sink to change state between on and off, which affects its behavior during the game.\n- isMoveable: Indicates that the sink cannot be moved. This property is set to false, reflecting the fixed nature of sinks in real-world scenarios.\n- isOn: Stores the state of the sink, whether it is currently on or off. This initial state can be set when the sink object is created.\n\nBehavior on Game Tick:\n- When the sink is on (isOn = True), the tick method adds water to any object within the sink that does not already contain water. This simulates filling objects with water when they are placed in an active sink. The method iterates through all objects contained within the sink, checks if they are instances of the Container class, and then checks if they already contain an item named \"water\". If not, it creates a new Water object and adds it to the container. This behavior emphasizes the sink's role in the game as a source of water for various objects.\n\nMethods:\n- makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False): Generates a string description of the sink, including its current state (on or off) and its contents. The level of detail in the description can be adjusted with the makeDetailed parameter.\n- turnOn(): Attempts to turn the sink on. If the sink is already on or is not activatable, it returns an error message and a success flag set to False. Otherwise, it sets the sink's state to on and returns a success message and flag.\n- turnOff(): Attempts to turn the sink off. Similar to turnOn(), it checks if the sink is off or not activatable and returns an appropriate message and success flag. If the sink can be turned off, it changes the sink's state to off and returns a success message and flag.\n\nThis class allows the sink to interact dynamically with the game environment, particularly in how it affects objects placed within it and how its state can be changed by the player.==========\nObject: Tool\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\ntype: the type of the tool, indicating its specific function or category within the game.\n\nExplanation:\nThe `Tool` class is designed to represent various tools within a text-based game, inheriting from the `GameObject` class. This inheritance implies that `Tool` objects are considered game objects, which can interact with other elements of the game world. The critical property defined in the `Tool` class is the \"type\" property, which specifies the tool's specific function or category. This could be anything from a \"hammer\" for building, a \"sword\" for combat, or a \"key\" for unlocking doors, depending on the game's design and the variety of tools it includes.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the tool, which includes an indefinite article ('a' or 'an') that correctly matches the initial sound of the tool's name (vowel sound or consonant sound). This method ensures that the tool is described in a grammatically correct manner when its description is displayed to the player. For example, if the tool's name is \"axe\", the description would be \"a axe\", and if the tool's name is \"orb\", the description would be \"an orb\". This attention to detail enhances the readability and immersion of the game's text-based interface.==========\nObject: Tree\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject`. The critical property inherited from `GameObject` is the `name` of the Tree, which is used to generate a description of the tree object.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method dynamically generates a description string for the tree object. It checks the first letter of the tree's name to determine the correct indefinite article (\"a\" or \"an\") to use based on whether the first letter is a vowel. This method ensures that the description of the tree object is grammatically correct with respect to English rules for articles, enhancing the readability and immersion of the game text. For example, it would correctly describe an object named \"Oak\" as \"a Oak\" and an object named \"Elm\" as \"an Elm\". \n\nThere is no `tick` method defined in this class, so there are no properties that change at each game tick.==========\nObject: Soil\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nwet: indicates whether the soil is wet or dry.\n\nThe `Soil` class inherits from `GameObject`, which suggests it is a basic object within the game, likely with properties and methods common to all game objects, such as an identifier or name. The critical property in the `Soil` class is `wet`, a boolean that determines the state of the soil - whether it is wet or dry. This property directly influences the description of the soil object, as seen in the `makeDescriptionStr` method. If `wet` is `True`, the soil is described as \"wet soil\"; otherwise, it is described as \"dry soil\". This property could potentially affect interactions with the soil within the game, such as planting seeds or the movement of characters, though such interactions are not detailed within the provided code snippet.==========\nObject: WaterContainer\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isWaterContainer: This property indicates that the object is capable of containing water. This is a critical property as it differentiates the WaterContainer from other types of containers that might not be designed to hold water. It implies that the object has been specifically designed or designated to hold water, which could affect how it interacts with other objects in the game (for example, it might be able to contain water without leaking, or it might have properties related to purifying water or keeping it at a certain temperature).\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the WaterContainer object. If the container has any objects within it, the method lists these objects in its description, indicating that the WaterContainer is not empty and specifying what it contains. If the container is empty, the description simply states that it is empty. This method enhances the game's interactivity by allowing players to receive detailed feedback about the state of the WaterContainer, including its contents.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties: None specified as critical within the `__init__` method.\n\nThe `World` class does not define any new properties in its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `Container` class. It is initialized with a name \"garden\", indicating its primary setting or theme. There are no critical properties commented within the `__init__` method, and there is no `tick` method defined in this class, so there are no dynamic property changes to describe at each game tick.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string that describes the garden, listing all objects contained within it. This method enhances the immersive experience by providing a detailed or simple description of the garden's contents, depending on the `makeDetailed` flag. However, since there are no specific critical properties or a `tick` method to discuss, the behavior of the `World` object remains static based on the provided code snippet.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `GameObject` and `Container` classes. Therefore, there are no specific critical properties to explain based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class is designed to represent an agent (e.g., a player character or an NPC) within the game. It inherits from the `Container` class, suggesting that the agent can hold or contain other objects, similar to how a player might carry items in an inventory.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this method is likely used to identify the agent within the game's narrative or command parsing system. This could be useful for commands or descriptions that refer to the player or agent themselves.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is likely used to generate a textual description of the agent. The `makeDetailed` parameter suggests that there could be a more detailed description available, but in this implementation, it does not alter the output, which remains a simple self-reference regardless of the `makeDetailed` flag's value.\n\nTick Method:\n- There is no `tick` method defined in the provided class definition, so there is no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.==========\n",
    "take-photo": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, which means they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless specified otherwise, objects in the game can be picked up, dropped, or moved to different locations.\n- temperature: Sets the initial temperature of the object to 20 degrees Celsius. This property implies that objects in the game can have a temperature attribute, which might be relevant for game mechanics involving heat, cold, or temperature changes.\n\nMethods:\n- getProperty: Safely retrieves a property value of the object by name, returning None if the property does not exist. This method ensures that accessing a property that hasn't been set won't cause an error.\n- addObject: Adds an object to this container (if it is a container) and handles the removal of the object from its previous container if it was contained elsewhere. This method is critical for managing the containment hierarchy of objects within the game.\n- removeObject: Removes an object from this container, if it is contained within. This method supports the dynamic reorganization of objects and their locations within the game world.\n- removeSelfFromContainer: Allows an object to remove itself from whatever container it is currently in, facilitating objects' ability to be moved or taken by players or other entities in the game.\n- getAllContainedObjectsRecursive: Retrieves a list of all objects contained within this object, and all objects contained within those objects, recursively. This method is useful for getting a complete inventory of nested objects, which could be important for game mechanics that require interaction with or manipulation of contained items.\n- containsItemWithName: Checks if this object (if it is a container) directly contains an item with a specific name, without searching recursively. This method could be used to verify the presence of specific items within a container, which might be necessary for completing tasks or puzzles within the game.\n- tick: A placeholder method intended to be overridden in subclasses. It's designed for performing any updates that need to happen at each step (tick) of the game, such as changing object properties based on game events or elapsed time.\n- getReferents: Provides a list of names or identifiers that can be used to refer to this object within the game, facilitating player interaction with objects through text commands.\n- makeDescriptionStr: Generates a human-readable description of the object, which can be displayed to the player. This method supports both a simple and a detailed description, allowing for flexible information presentation based on the context.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational element for creating interactive objects within a text-based game, providing essential properties and methods for managing object identity, containment, and description.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the contents within the container. If a container is closed, players may not be able to place objects in it or take objects from it without first opening it.\n- containerPrefix: This property defines how the container is referred to in relation to contained objects (e.g., \"in the box\", \"on the table\"). It is critical for generating descriptive text that accurately reflects the spatial relationship between the container and its contents.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly modifies the `isOpen` property by setting it to True when the container is successfully opened.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly modifies the `isOpen` property by setting it to False when the container is successfully closed.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object to within the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is moveable and currently inside the container. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken, and a boolean flag indicating success or failure. This method changes the game's state by removing an object from the container.\n\nThe `Container` class, by inheriting from `GameObject`, gains all the properties and methods of a basic game object, with additional functionality specific to objects that can contain other objects. The critical properties and methods enable complex interactions with containers, such as opening, closing, inserting, and removing objects, which are essential for gameplay mechanics involving inventory management, puzzle-solving, and exploration.==========\nObject: Device\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- isDevice: Indicates that the object is a device. This property is set to True, meaning every instance of this class or its subclasses is recognized as a device within the game.\n- isActivatable: Determines whether the device can be turned on or off. This is set to True, indicating that the device is designed to have an active state (on) and an inactive state (off).\n- isOn: Tracks the current state of the device, whether it is on or off. Initially set to False, indicating that devices start in the off state.\n\nMethods:\n- turnOn: Attempts to turn the device on. If the device is not activatable or is already on, it returns an error message and a success flag set to False. Otherwise, it sets `isOn` to True and returns a success message and flag.\n- turnOff: Attempts to turn the device off. Similar to `turnOn`, it checks if the device is activatable and not already off. If conditions are met, it sets `isOn` to False and returns a success message and flag.\n- useWithObject: Provides a template for interacting with another object (referred to as `patientObject`). By default, it returns a message indicating uncertainty about how to use the device with the specified object, along with a success flag set to False. This method is likely intended to be overridden in subclasses to implement specific interactions.\n- makeDescriptionStr: Generates a human-readable description of the device, including its name and whether it is currently on or off. This method enhances the game's user interface by providing clear information about the device's state.\n\nThe `Device` class is designed to be a base class for any game object that behaves like a device, offering basic functionality for turning the device on or off and setting a foundation for more complex interactions in subclasses.==========\nObject: Camera\nInherits: Device\n\nProperties:\n- **shutter_speed_dial**: This is a list of available shutter speeds for the camera, ranging from very fast (1/4000) to very slow (8 seconds). This allows the camera to capture images in various lighting conditions and motion scenarios.\n- **iso_dial**: This list represents the available ISO settings on the camera, from low (64) to high (6400). ISO affects the camera sensor's sensitivity to light, with higher values useful in darker conditions but potentially introducing more noise (graininess) to the photo.\n- **aperture_dial**: Contains the available aperture settings, from wide (1.4) to narrow (16). Aperture affects the amount of light entering the lens and the depth of field of the photographs, influencing how much of the image is in sharp focus.\n- **current_shutter_speed**: This property is set to a random value within the range of available shutter speeds upon initialization, determining how long the camera's sensor is exposed to light when a photo is taken.\n- **current_iso**: Set randomly from the available ISO settings on initialization, this affects the camera's sensitivity to light.\n- **current_aperture**: Also randomly set from the available apertures on initialization, this determines the size of the lens opening when a photo is taken.\n- **current_focus**: Initially set to None, this property can be changed to focus on different objects within the game, affecting the subject of the photographs taken.\n- **photo**: Initially None, this property stores information about the last photo taken, including the focus subject and the settings used (shutter speed, aperture, and ISO).\n\nMethods:\n- **rotate_dial(which_dial, clockwise)**: Allows the player to adjust the camera's settings by rotating the specified dial (aperture, ISO, or shutter speed) either clockwise or counterclockwise. This changes the corresponding current setting to the next or previous value in its range.\n- **shutter()**: Simulates taking a photo with the current settings and focus. It captures the name of the focused object (if any) and the current camera settings, storing them in the `photo` property.\n- **focus(something)**: Changes the camera's focus to a specified object, updating the `current_focus` property to reflect the object's name. If the camera is attempted to be focused on itself, it returns a message indicating this is not possible.\n- **makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False)**: Generates a descriptive string of the camera's current state, including its loaded status, current settings (shutter speed, aperture, ISO), and what it is focusing on. It also provides information on how to change settings and the range of available values for each dial.\n\nThis class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.==========\nObject: Food\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nisFood: Indicates that the object is food, which is a critical property for interactions within the game that require food items.\n\nThe `Food` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no need to describe how its properties change at each game tick. The critical property set in the `__init__` method is `isFood`, which is set to `True` to signify that instances of this class represent food items within the game. This property likely influences how other objects or characters within the game interact with it, such as eating or cooking. The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple description of the food item, which includes its name, making it easier for players to identify the food item within the game.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties: None specified as critical within the `__init__` method.\n\nThe `World` class does not explicitly define any critical properties within its `__init__` method, nor does it contain a `tick` method to describe changes to its properties over time. However, by inheriting from the `Container` class, it implicitly gains the ability to contain other objects, which is a critical aspect of its functionality in the context of a text game. The `World` object, named \"kitchen\" in this context, serves as a container for other objects within the game, representing a space where various game objects can be placed and interacted with.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the `World` object and its contents. When called, it generates a string that describes the player's current location (in this case, a kitchen) and lists the objects contained within it. This method supports both a simple and a detailed description, depending on the `makeDetailed` flag, although the provided code snippet does not differentiate between these two modes in its implementation. The method iterates over the objects contained within the `World` (kitchen) and appends their descriptions to the output string, providing players with a narrative view of their surroundings and the items available for interaction.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method as per the given instructions. However, by inheriting from `Container`, it implicitly has access to all properties and methods of the `Container` class, which includes managing contained objects and possibly other container-specific behaviors.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class represents an entity in the game that can contain other objects, similar to how a player character might carry items. This is inferred from its inheritance of the `Container` class.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, suggesting that this class is intended to represent the player or an NPC (Non-Player Character) as themselves within the game world. This method could be used in the game's text parsing system to refer to the agent when interpreting commands or descriptions.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This indicates that whenever the game needs to describe this agent, it will refer to it as \"yourself\", reinforcing the idea that this class is meant to represent the player or an NPC from their own perspective.\n- Since there is no `tick` method defined in this class, there are no properties that change at each game tick based on the provided code snippet.==========\n",
    "sweep-floor": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class and does not inherit from any other class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers unless specified otherwise.\n- isMoveable: Determines if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable.\n- isUsable: Specifies if the object can be used for some action. By default, objects are not usable unless specified.\n- isActivatable: Indicates whether the object can be activated or turned on/off. By default, objects are not activatable.\n- temperature: Represents the temperature of the object, which is set to 20.0 degrees Celsius by default.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all game objects. It includes mechanisms for managing an object's containment within other objects, its moveability, usability, and activatability, as well as its temperature. The class also includes methods for adding and removing objects from containers, getting properties safely, and generating descriptions of the object. The `tick` method is defined but does not perform any actions, allowing derived classes to override this method to implement specific behaviors that occur at each game tick.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- **isContainer**: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, which is fundamental to its role in the game.\n- **isOpenable**: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how the container interacts with other objects and players. For example, an openable container (like a chest or a door) can be opened to access its contents or pass through, while a non-openable container (like a table) does not have this functionality.\n- **isOpen**: Specifies whether the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property because it directly impacts what actions can be performed with or on the container, such as whether objects can be placed in or taken out of it.\n- **containerPrefix**: This property defines how the container is referred to in the game's narrative context (e.g., \"in the box\", \"on the table\"). It's critical for generating descriptive text that accurately reflects the spatial relationship between the container and its contents.\n\nMethods and Their Impact on Properties:\n- **openContainer()**: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method directly modifies the `isOpen` property by setting it to True if the container is successfully opened, thereby changing how the container can interact with its contents and the players.\n- **closeContainer()**: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. Similar to `openContainer()`, this method affects the `isOpen` property by setting it to False upon successful closure, impacting the container's functionality in the game.\n- **placeObjectInContainer(obj)**: Tries to place an object inside the container, assuming the container is open and the object is moveable. This method impacts the game's state by potentially adding an object to the container's contents, thereby changing the container's description and how it interacts with the game world.\n- **takeObjectFromContainer(obj)**: Attempts to remove an object from the container, provided the container is open, and the object is moveable and currently inside the container. This method can change the container's contents by removing the specified object, affecting the container's description and its interactions within the game.\n- **makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False)**: Generates a human-readable description of the container and its contents. This method does not directly change any properties but provides a narrative output based on the current state of the container and its contents, which can include details such as whether it's empty or what it contains, depending on the `makeDetailed` parameter.\n\nIn summary, the `Container` class defines an object that can hold other objects within the game, with properties and methods that manage its open/closed state, its ability to contain objects, and how it is described within the game's narrative context.==========\nObject: Tool\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject`. The critical property inherited from `GameObject` is the `name` of the tool, which is a fundamental identifier for any game object.\n\nThe `Tool` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple description of the tool, indicating its name, which can be detailed or not, but in this case, the detail flag does not alter the output.==========\nObject: Garbage\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- isMoveable: Indicates that the garbage cannot be directly taken by the agent, meaning it is immovable within the game context.\n\nThe `Garbage` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no properties that change at each game tick. The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a way to generate a description of the garbage object, which varies depending on whether the garbage is on the ground (in which case it is contained within a `World` object) or not. If the garbage is on the ground, the description will include its name followed by \"on the ground\". If it is not on the ground (meaning it is contained within another container that is not the `World`), the description will simply be its name.==========\nObject: GarbageCan\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- isMoveable: Indicates that the garbage can cannot be directly moved by the agent. This property is set to False, meaning that within the game's mechanics, the garbage can is considered to be stationary or fixed in place. This could be due to its role in the game or the physical characteristics attributed to it, such as being too heavy or bolted down.\n- isOpenable: This property is set to True, suggesting that the garbage can has a lid or some form of opening mechanism that allows it to be opened or closed. This feature could be relevant for gameplay mechanics involving storing or retrieving items from the garbage can.\n- isOpen: Initially set to False, indicating that the garbage can starts off closed. This property likely interacts with the game's mechanics by requiring the player to perform an action to open the garbage can before they can place items inside it or remove items from it.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties in the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a \"world\" or \"room\" within the game, which can contain other objects. The critical aspect of this class is its ability to contain other objects and describe its contents.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the world (or room) and its contents. If there are objects within the world, it lists them with indentation for readability. This method enhances the immersive experience by providing a detailed description of the player's surroundings, including all objects present in the world or room. The use of `'\\n'.join([\"\\t\" + desc for desc in obj.makeDescriptionStr().strip().split('\\n')])` ensures that if an object's description contains multiple lines, each line is properly indented, maintaining a consistent and organized appearance in the detailed description. \n\nHowever, there is no `tick` method defined in this class, so there is no behavior described that changes the properties of the world or its contents over time (per game tick).==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no specific critical properties to discuss. However, it's worth noting the unique aspects of this class as they relate to its role in the game.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class represents an entity in the game that can contain other objects, as indicated by its inheritance from the `Container` class. This suggests that the agent can carry or hold items, similar to how a player character might have an inventory in a text-based game.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`. This method likely serves to provide references or identifiers for the agent object within the game world, suggesting that this class is intended to represent the player or a character through which the player interacts with the game world.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is designed to provide a textual description of the object (in this case, the agent) for display purposes within the game. The simplicity of the return value suggests that the agent's description is not meant to be detailed or dynamic but is instead a straightforward acknowledgment of the player's presence or identity in the game world.\n\nSince there is no `tick` method defined in the provided class, there are no properties that change at each game tick to discuss.==========\n",
    "balance-scale-heaviest": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or through other game mechanics.\n\nMethods:\n- `getProperty(propertyName)`: Safely retrieves a property of the object, returning `None` if the property doesn't exist. This method ensures that accessing a property that has not been set will not cause an error.\n- `addObject(obj)`: Adds an object to this container (if it is a container), removing it from its previous container. This method manages the containment hierarchy within the game, ensuring objects are correctly moved between containers.\n- `removeObject(obj)`: Removes an object from this container. It is used to manage the contents of containers within the game, ensuring objects can be removed when necessary.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer()`: Removes the current object from whatever container it's currently in. This method allows an object to be disassociated from its parent container, effectively moving it to a 'loose' state within the game world.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive()`: Retrieves all objects contained within this object, recursively. This method is useful for getting a complete list of all objects within a container and all objects within those objects, etc.\n- `containsItemWithName(name)`: Checks if this object contains an item with a specific name (not recursively). This method allows for searching the immediate contents of a container for an object with a specific name.\n- `tick()`: A placeholder for performing any internal updates that need to be performed at each step of the game. In this base class, it does nothing, but derived classes can override this method to implement specific behavior that occurs at each game tick.\n- `getReferents()`: Returns a list of names (referents) that this object can be called by. This method is useful for identifying objects within the game through various names or identifiers.\n- `makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False)`: Generates a human-readable string that describes this object. This method is essential for providing textual descriptions of objects within the game, which can be displayed to the player.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the text game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all game objects. It handles identification (through a unique ID and name), containment (both being able to contain other objects and being contained within another object), and basic property management. This class is designed to be extended by more specific object classes that will inherit these basic capabilities and add their own specific properties and behaviors.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts what actions can be performed with or on the container (e.g., placing objects inside it or taking objects from it).\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the `isOpen` property based on the conditions met.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the `isOpen` property based on the conditions met.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object to inside the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is moveable and contained within. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken, and a boolean flag indicating success or failure. This method changes the game's state by altering the location of an object from inside the container to another location or to the player's inventory.\n- makeDescriptionStr: Generates a human-readable description of the container, which can be detailed or brief depending on the `makeDetailed` flag. This method is important for providing players with information about the container and its contents in a format that is easy to understand.\n\nThe `Container` class, by inheriting from `GameObject`, gains all the properties and methods of a generic game object, with additional properties and methods specific to objects that can contain other objects. The critical properties and methods of the `Container` class are designed to manage the interactions between the container and its contents, as well as how players can interact with the container (e.g., opening, closing, placing objects inside, and taking objects out).==========\nObject: BalanceScale\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isMoveable: Indicates that the balance scale cannot be moved. This property is critical because it affects how the player can interact with the balance scale within the game environment. Since the balance scale is immovable, it suggests that the player must bring objects to the scale to use it, rather than taking the scale to objects.\n\nThe BalanceScale class represents a balance scale object within the game, which is used to weigh objects placed on its two sides (left and right). Each side of the scale is itself a container, capable of holding multiple objects. The critical functionality of the BalanceScale revolves around comparing the total mass of objects on its two sides to determine which side is heavier or if they are in balance.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a detailed description of the balance scale, including which side is heavier or if the scale is balanced, and what objects are on each side. This method dynamically generates descriptions based on the current state of the objects on the scale, making it an essential feature for player interaction and understanding the current state of the game.\n\nThe `get_mass` method calculates the total mass of objects on one side of the scale by iterating through all objects contained on that side and summing their weights. This functionality is crucial for determining the state of balance between the two sides.\n\nThe `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive` method is designed to retrieve all objects placed on both sides of the scale, including those within nested containers. This method ensures that the game can account for all objects when calculating the total mass on each side of the scale or when needing to list all objects for player interaction purposes.\n\nThe `placeObjectInContainer` and `takeObjectFromContainer` methods override the default container behavior to enforce that objects cannot be directly placed on or taken from the balance scale without specifying which side of the scale they are interacting with. This restriction is vital for maintaining the logical operation of the balance scale within the game, ensuring that players must explicitly decide where to place objects to weigh them.\n\nOverall, the BalanceScale class introduces an interactive game object that allows for the weighing of items, contributing to puzzle-solving or other gameplay mechanics where object weight comparison is necessary.==========\nObject: Cube\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nweight: Represents the mass of the cube, indicating how heavy it is. This property is directly set from the `mass` parameter passed during the initialization of a Cube instance.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties: None specified as critical within the `__init__` method.\n\nThe `World` class does not define any new properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `Container` class. It is initialized with a type of \"room\", indicating its primary function as a container for other objects within the game environment, presumably to represent a room in the game world. There are no critical properties commented within the `__init__` method, and the class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no dynamic property changes to describe at each game tick.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the world (or room) and its contents. If the room contains objects, it lists them by calling their `makeDescriptionStr` method, which suggests that objects within the world can have their descriptive methods for detailed output. This method supports both a simple and a detailed description, although the detailed flag does not change the behavior in the provided implementation.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `GameObject` and `Container` classes. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no specific critical properties to discuss. However, it's worth noting that as a `Container`, the `Agent` object can hold other objects, implying it has properties related to containing other objects, such as an inventory system in a text game.\n\nThe `Agent` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there's no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.\n\nAdditional Methods:\n- `getReferents`: This method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, which suggests that in the context of the game, the `Agent` object represents the player or a character that the player controls. This method could be used to identify the object in text commands or descriptions within the game.\n  \n- `makeDescriptionStr`: This method returns the string `\"yourself\"` when called, with the `makeDetailed` parameter not affecting the output in this implementation. This indicates that whenever the game needs to describe the `Agent` object, it will simply refer to it as \"yourself,\" reinforcing the idea that this object represents the player or their character in the game.==========\n",
    "dishwasher": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or through other game mechanics.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. It includes mechanisms for handling unique identifiers (UUIDs), naming, containment (both holding other objects and being contained within another object), and property management. The class also outlines a structure for updating object states during game ticks, though it does not implement specific tick behavior, leaving that to be defined by subclasses.\n\nCritical Methods and Their Effects:\n- `addObject(self, obj)`: Adds an object to this object's containment list, effectively making this object a container for the added object. This method also handles removing the object from its previous container, if any, and updating its parent container reference.\n- `removeObject(self, obj)`: Removes an object from this object's containment list, and clears the object's parent container reference, effectively disassociating the two objects.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer(self)`: Removes this object from its current parent container's containment list, if it has a parent container, effectively making this object no longer contained by that parent.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive(self)`: Returns a list of all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects, allowing for a recursive traversal of the containment hierarchy.\n- `tick(self)`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden by subclasses to define specific behavior that occurs at each game tick, such as updating object states or triggering events. In `GameObject`, it does nothing, serving as a default implementation.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not directly inherit from any other classes, making it a base class from which other more specific game object classes can be derived. Its design allows for a flexible framework that can be extended to accommodate a wide variety of object types and behaviors within the game.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the container's contents. If a container is closed, players may not be able to place objects in it or take objects from it without first opening it.\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This action changes the 'isOpen' property to True if successful, allowing access to the container's contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This action changes the 'isOpen' property to False if successful, securing the contents within the container.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This action is contingent on the 'isContainer' and 'isOpen' properties, as well as the 'isMoveable' property of the object being placed.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This action depends on the 'isContainer' and 'isOpen' properties of the container and the 'isMoveable' property of the object being removed.\n\nThe Container class, by inheriting from GameObject, gains the foundational attributes and methods of a game object, such as a unique name and the ability to interact with other objects in the game world. The critical properties and methods of the Container class extend this functionality, allowing the Container to act as a storage mechanism within the game, with specific rules governing how objects can be added to or removed from it based on its state (open or closed) and its inherent capabilities (whether it is openable).==========\nObject: Device\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isDevice: Indicates that this object is a device. This property is set to True, meaning every instance of this class or its subclasses is recognized as a device within the game.\n- isActivatable: Determines whether the device can be turned on or off. This is set to True, indicating that the device is designed to have an on and off state, making it interactable in this manner within the game.\n- isOn: Specifies the current state of the device, whether it is on or off. Initially set to False, indicating that devices start in the off state when they are first created or introduced into the game environment.\n\nMethods:\n- turnOn(): This method attempts to turn the device on. It first checks if the device is activatable. If it is not, it returns a message indicating that it's unclear how to turn the device on, along with a success flag set to False. If the device is already on, it returns a message stating that the device is already on, with the success flag set to False. If the device can be turned on, it sets the `isOn` property to True and returns a message indicating success, with the success flag set to True.\n- turnOff(): Similar to `turnOn()`, but for turning the device off. It checks if the device is activatable and if it is already off, returning appropriate messages and a success flag in each case. If the device can be turned off, it sets the `isOn` property to False and returns a message indicating success, with the success flag set to True.\n- useWithObject(patientObject): This method provides a template for interacting with another object (referred to as `patientObject`). By default, it returns a message indicating uncertainty about how to use the device with the specified object, along with a success flag set to False. This method can be overridden in subclasses to implement specific interactions between devices and other objects.\n- makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False): Generates a human-readable description of the device, indicating its name and whether it is currently on or off. This method provides a simple way to convey the state of the device to the player.\n\nThe `Device` class is designed to represent any object within the game that can be turned on or off, providing a foundation for creating interactive and dynamic objects within the game world. Its methods allow for basic interactions, such as turning the device on or off, and set a pattern for more complex interactions with other objects through subclassing and method overriding.==========\nObject: DishWasher\nInherits: Container, Device\n\nProperties:\n- isOpenable: Indicates that a dishwasher can be opened, allowing access to its contents.\n- isOpen: Reflects whether the dishwasher is currently open or closed, with the default state being closed.\n- isMoveable: Suggests that the dishwasher is too heavy to be moved, aligning with its typical real-world use where it remains stationary.\n- cycleStage: Represents the current stage of the dishwasher's cleaning cycle. It starts at 0 (not running), progresses to 1 (washing), and ends at 2 (finished). This property is critical for understanding the operational state of the dishwasher during its cycle.\n- finishedCycle: A boolean flag that becomes True once the dishwasher has completed its washing cycle. This property is reset to False when the dishwasher is opened, indicating that the dishes inside are clean and the cycle can be restarted after loading new dishes and closing the door.\n\nBehavior (tick method):\n- If the dishwasher is open, it automatically turns off, resets the finishedCycle flag to False, and sets the cycleStage back to 0, indicating that the cycle has been interrupted or is ready to start anew.\n- When the dishwasher is on, it progresses through its cycle stages with each tick. If it reaches stage 2 and contains soap, it cleans the dishes inside. Any soap used during the cycle is removed from the dishwasher, simulating the consumption of soap during the washing process.\n- Upon reaching stage 3, the dishwasher marks the cycle as finished by setting finishedCycle to True, resets the cycleStage to 0, and turns itself off, indicating that the washing process is complete and the dishes are clean.\n- The dishwasher's behavior ensures that dishes are only washed if the dishwasher is closed, turned on, contains soap, and progresses through its cycle stages properly. This simulates a realistic dishwasher operation within the game environment.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a dynamic description of the dishwasher's current state, including whether it's on or off, open or closed, empty or contains items, and if it has finished a cycle, indicated by a blinking green light. This description aids players in understanding the dishwasher's status and deciding their next actions in the game.==========\nObject: Dish\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- dishType: This property specifies the type of the dish (e.g., \"plate\", \"bowl\", \"cup\"). It is a critical property because it defines the nature and possibly the use of the dish within the game context.\n- isDirty: A boolean indicating whether the dish starts as clean or dirty. This is critical as it affects interactions with the dish; for example, a dirty dish might need to be cleaned before it can be used again, affecting gameplay decisions.\n- foodMessName: If the dish is initialized as dirty, this property holds the name of the food that made the dish dirty. This adds to the realism and depth of the game by providing a reason why the dish is dirty, potentially influencing player decisions (e.g., cleaning the dish or reacting to the type of food mess).\n\nMethods:\n- makeDirty(foodName): This method sets the dish's `isDirty` property to True and assigns the `foodMessName` property the name of the food causing the mess. This method is crucial for dynamically changing the state of the dish based on player actions or game events, such as eating.\n- makeClean(): This method sets the dish's `isDirty` property to False and clears the `foodMessName`. It represents an action that can change the state of the dish, reflecting the cleaning process within the game.\n- getReferents(): This method provides a list of names or descriptions by which the dish can be referred to in the game. It dynamically adjusts based on the dish's cleanliness, enhancing the game's interactivity and realism by allowing for more natural language commands or descriptions.\n- makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False): Generates a descriptive string for the dish, including its cleanliness state, type, and any contents or food mess. This method is essential for providing players with detailed descriptions of their environment and the objects within it, contributing to a more immersive game experience.\n\nThe `Dish` class, by inheriting from `Container`, also implies that dishes can contain other objects, which is typical in text-based games for representing items stored within other items. The `containerPrefix` property, set to \"in\" by default, is used in descriptions to indicate where contained objects are in relation to the dish (e.g., \"in the bowl\"). This functionality is critical for creating a realistic and interactive game environment where players can interact with objects in intuitive ways.==========\nObject: DishSoapBottle\nInherits: Device\n\nProperties:\n- There are no critical properties explicitly defined in the `__init__` method for the `DishSoapBottle` class. However, the class inherits from `Device`, which suggests that it has properties and behaviors associated with devices in the game, such as being identifiable by a name (`\"bottle of dish soap\"` in this case).\n\nThe `useWithObject` method is particularly noteworthy for understanding the intended use and interaction of the `DishSoapBottle` within the game:\n- This method allows the `DishSoapBottle` to interact with other objects in the game environment. Specifically, it can be used with objects of type `Dish` or `DishWasher`. When used with these objects, it adds a `Soap` object to them, simulating the action of squirting dish soap on a dish or into a dishwasher. This interaction returns a string describing the action taken and a success flag (`True` for successful interaction with `Dish` or `DishWasher`, `False` otherwise).\n- If the `DishSoapBottle` is attempted to be used with an object that is not a `Dish` or `DishWasher`, the method returns a string indicating uncertainty about how to use the item and a success flag set to `False`.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple string representation of the `DishSoapBottle`, which is customizable based on whether detailed information is requested. However, in this implementation, the detail flag does not alter the description, resulting in a consistent description of `\"a bottle of dish soap\"` regardless of the `makeDetailed` argument.\n\nIn summary, the `DishSoapBottle` is a device designed for interaction with specific types of objects within the game (namely `Dish` and `DishWasher`), enabling actions that simulate the application of dish soap to these objects. Its behavior is defined by its ability to modify the state of these objects by adding a `Soap` object to them, reflecting its use in a typical dish-cleaning scenario.==========\nObject: Soap\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject`. The critical property inherited and set in the `__init__` method is the `name` of the object, which is set to \"dish soap\". This property is essential for identifying the object within the game.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a way to generate a descriptive string for the soap object. When this method is called, it returns a string that describes the object using its `name` property, formatted as \"a squirt of dish soap\". This method supports an optional `makeDetailed` parameter, but it does not alter the output in this implementation, meaning the description remains the same regardless of the detail level requested. \n\nThere is no `tick` method defined in this class, so there are no properties that change at each game tick for the Soap object.==========\nObject: Food\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nisFood: Indicates that the object is food, which is a critical property for interactions within the game that require food items.\n\nThe `Food` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no changes to the object properties at each game tick to describe.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties: None specified as critical within the `__init__` function.\n\nThe `World` class does not explicitly define any new properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `Container` class. It is initialized with a name (\"kitchen\"), indicating its primary setting or theme. The class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior described that changes the object's properties over time or in response to game ticks.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a way to generate a descriptive string about the world, specifically focusing on its role as a kitchen in this context. This method, when called, constructs a narrative that places the player in a kitchen and lists all objects contained within this world (the kitchen), using the `makeDescriptionStr` method of each contained object to describe them in detail if `makeDetailed` is set to `True`. This approach allows for dynamic descriptions based on the current state of the world and its contents, enhancing the immersive experience of the text game by providing detailed environmental context and interactions with the objects within the world.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `GameObject` and `Container` classes. Therefore, there are no specific critical properties to discuss based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class is designed to represent an agent (e.g., a player character or an NPC) within the game. It inherits from the `Container` class, suggesting that the agent can hold or contain other objects, similar to how a player might carry items in an inventory.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this method is likely used to refer to the agent within the game's narrative or command parsing context. This could be useful for commands or descriptions that involve the player directly.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is likely used to generate a textual description of the agent. The `makeDetailed` parameter is present but not used in the method's body, suggesting that, in its current form, the method does not differentiate between detailed and brief descriptions. This could be a placeholder for more complex behavior in a more developed version of the class.==========\n",
    "volume-container": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- `isContainer`: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- `isMoveable`: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless specified otherwise, objects can be relocated within the game environment.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic attributes and methods that are common across various types of objects. It includes mechanisms for handling object identification (through a unique ID or `uuid`), containment (whether an object can contain other objects and the management of such containment), and properties (a dictionary that can store various attributes specific to the object).\n\nCritical Methods and Their Effects:\n- `addObject(self, obj)`: Adds an object to this container, effectively making this object its parent container. This method also removes the object from its previous container if it had one, ensuring that objects are not simultaneously contained in multiple locations.\n- `removeObject(self, obj)`: Removes an object from this container, clearing its parent container attribute. This is used to manage the contents of a container dynamically.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer(self)`: Removes the current object from its parent container, if it has one. This method is crucial for reorganizing objects within the game world, allowing for dynamic interactions and movements.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive(self)`: Retrieves all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects, recursively. This is useful for operations that need to consider every object within a container, no matter the depth.\n- `containsItemWithName(self, name)`: Searches for objects with a specific name directly contained within this object (not recursively). This can be used to find specific items within a container without considering nested objects.\n- `tick(self)`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden in subclasses. It's designed for objects that need to update their state at each game tick, such as changing properties over time or reacting to game events.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not inherently change any properties at each game tick since its `tick` method is empty. This behavior is intended to be defined in subclasses that inherit from `GameObject`, where specific behaviors and property changes can be implemented according to the needs of those objects.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts what actions can be performed with or on the container (e.g., placing objects inside it or taking objects from it).\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure and a boolean flag representing the outcome. This method directly modifies the isOpen property.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure and a boolean flag representing the outcome. This method directly modifies the isOpen property.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure and a boolean flag representing the outcome. This method affects the game state by changing the location of an object to inside the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is not a liquid. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken (if successful), and a boolean flag representing the outcome. This method affects the game state by changing the location of an object from inside the container to another location.\n- makeDescriptionStr: Generates a human-readable description of the container, which can be detailed or brief depending on the makeDetailed flag. This method is important for providing players with information about the container and its contents in a format that is easy to understand.==========\nObject: Water\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- isLiquid: Indicates that water is a liquid. This property is critical for interactions that depend on the state of matter, such as pouring or mixing.\n- volume: Represents the volume of the water. This is a critical property as it affects how much space the water occupies in a container and can influence actions like pouring, transferring, or combining with other substances.\n\nThe `Water` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no changes to its properties at each game tick based on this implementation. The properties set in the `__init__` method are static unless explicitly changed by game logic outside of this class definition.==========\nObject: Sink\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isActivatable: Indicates that a sink can be activated or turned on. This property allows the sink to change state from off to on, which is critical for its function in the game.\n- isMoveable: Indicates that the sink cannot be moved. This property is set to false, reflecting the fixed nature of sinks in real-world scenarios.\n- isOn: Stores the state of the sink, whether it is currently on or off. This initial state can be set when the sink object is created, affecting how it interacts with other objects in the game.\n\nTick Method:\n- The tick method for the Sink object adds water to any object within the sink that does not already have water on it, but only if the sink is turned on. This method iterates through all objects contained within the sink, checking if each object is a WaterContainer. If an object within the sink does not contain water, the method adds water to it, filling it to the container's maximum volume. This simulates filling objects with water over time, which could be an essential mechanic for puzzles or tasks within the game that require water.\n\nmakeDescriptionStr Method:\n- This method generates a string description of the sink, including its current state (on or off) and its contents. If the sink is on, the description will reflect that; if it is off, the description will also indicate this. The method can provide a detailed list of the sink's contents if requested, enhancing the interactive experience by allowing players to understand what objects are in the sink and their state.\n\nturnOn and turnOff Methods:\n- These methods allow the sink to be turned on or off, respectively. They check if the action is possible (based on the sink's current state and whether it is activatable) and return a message indicating the action's success or failure, along with a boolean flag. These methods enable dynamic interaction with the sink, allowing players to control its state as part of their gameplay strategy or to solve puzzles.==========\nObject: WaterContainer\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isWaterContainer: This property indicates that the object is specifically designed to hold water. This could be used in the game to determine if the object can be filled with or used to transport water, which might be necessary for solving puzzles or for survival mechanics.\n- volume: This property specifies the volume of the water container. This could be critical for gameplay elements that require the player to manage resources, such as needing a certain amount of water to achieve a task. The volume could limit how much water the player can carry or store at any given time, making it a strategic resource to manage.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the water container. If the container holds any items, it lists them as being contained within it. If it's empty, the description simply states that it is empty. This method enhances the interactive and immersive experience of the game by providing detailed descriptions based on the container's state and contents.==========\nObject: Graduated Cylinder\nInherits: WaterContainer\n\nProperties:\n- There are no explicitly commented critical properties in the `__init__` method for the Graduated Cylinder. However, based on the inherited class and the implementation, we can infer the critical property as follows:\n  - `volume`: This is likely a critical property inherited from the WaterContainer class, indicating the total volume the graduated cylinder can hold. This is not directly shown in the provided code snippet but can be inferred from the context and the parameter passed to the `WaterContainer.__init__` method.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the graduated cylinder, including its name and the volume of liquid it contains, if any. If the cylinder contains one or more objects (in this context, likely representing liquids), it calculates the total volume of these contained liquids and includes this information in the description. If the cylinder is empty (i.e., contains no liquids), the description reflects this by stating that the cylinder is empty.\n\nThis class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- The World class does not explicitly define any critical properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a room or a world within the game, capable of containing other objects. The critical aspect of this class lies in its ability to aggregate and display the descriptions of the objects it contains, rather than in specific, individual properties.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method is crucial for providing a textual representation of the world or room, including detailed descriptions of all contained objects if requested. This method enhances the immersive experience of the text game by dynamically generating descriptions based on the current state of the world and the objects within it. However, since there are no properties explicitly defined as critical within the `__init__` method and no `tick` method is present, there are no property changes over time to describe in this context.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `GameObject` and `Container` classes. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no specific critical properties to discuss. However, it's worth noting the unique aspects of this class as it relates to its role in the game.\n\nThe `Agent` class represents an entity in the game that can contain other objects, as indicated by its inheritance from the `Container` class. This suggests that the agent can carry or hold items, which is a common feature for player characters or NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in text-based games.\n\nThe `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, which implies that this class is intended to represent the player or an NPC from a first-person perspective. This method could be used in the game's text parsing system to recognize references to the player or the NPC when interpreting player input or generating descriptions.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is likely used to generate a text description of the agent within the game. The lack of detail in the description and the absence of the `makeDetailed` parameter's influence suggest that this class is either a base class meant to be extended with more specific details in subclasses or that the simplicity is by design to fit the game's narrative style.\n\nIn summary, the `Agent` class is designed to represent a character in the game that can carry items and is referred to from a first-person perspective. The class does not define additional properties beyond its ability to contain items and its identity as an agent within the game world. There is no `tick` method present, so there are no changes to properties at each game tick to discuss.==========\n",
    "balance-scale-weigh": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or by other means within the game environment.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. It includes mechanisms for handling unique identifiers (UUIDs) for each object, managing containment relationships (both holding other objects and being contained within another object), and basic property management (setting, getting, and checking properties).\n\nCritical Methods:\n- `addObject(self, obj)`: Adds an object to this container, effectively making this object its parent container. This method also removes the object from any previous container it might have been in, ensuring that objects are not simultaneously contained in multiple locations.\n- `removeObject(self, obj)`: Removes an object from this container, clearing its parent container property. This is used to manage the containment hierarchy within the game.\n- `removeSelfFromContainer(self)`: Removes this object from its current parent container, if it has one. This method is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the containment hierarchy when objects are moved or removed.\n- `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive(self)`: Retrieves all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects, recursively. This is useful for operations that need to consider every object within a container, no matter how deeply nested.\n- `containsItemWithName(self, name)`: Checks if this object directly contains any objects with a specific name, without searching recursively. This can be used to find objects by name within the immediate contents of a container.\n- `tick(self)`: A placeholder method intended to be overridden in subclasses. It's designed to perform any updates or checks that need to happen at each step (tick) of the game. In the base class, it does nothing, serving as a hook for game logic in derived classes.\n- `getReferents(self)`: Returns a list of names or identifiers by which this object can be referred. By default, it includes the object's name and unique identifier.\n- `makeDescriptionStr(self, makeDetailed=False)`: Generates a human-readable description of the object. This can be used to provide players with information about objects within the game. The method can optionally provide a more detailed description, depending on the implementation in subclasses.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not inherit from any other classes, making it a base class from which other game object classes can derive. It establishes a common interface and set of properties that are essential for the interaction of objects within the game world.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts the accessibility of the container's contents. If a container is closed, players may not be able to place or take objects from it without opening it first.\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to True if successful, allowing access to the container's contents.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. This method changes the 'isOpen' property to False if successful, securing the container's contents.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object, placing it inside the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is indeed inside the container. This method changes the game's state by altering the location of an object, removing it from the container.\n\nThe Container class, by inheriting from GameObject, gains all the properties and methods of a GameObject, with additional properties and behaviors specific to containers. These include the ability to contain other objects, and the mechanisms to open, close, place objects in, and take objects out of the container, which are essential for interactive gameplay involving item management and environmental exploration.==========\nObject: BalanceScale\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isMoveable: Indicates that the balance scale cannot be moved. This is critical because it defines the scale as a stationary object within the game environment, which affects how players can interact with it.\n\nThe BalanceScale class represents a balance scale with two sides, each side being a container that can hold objects. The critical properties and functionalities of this object include:\n\n1. **Non-moveability**: Both the balance scale itself and its two sides (left and right) are marked as non-moveable. This property is critical as it affects how the object can be interacted with within the game. Players cannot move the scale or its sides, which is realistic for a balance scale used in a setting where it is meant to stay in one place for weighing objects.\n\n2. **Two Sides as Containers**: The balance scale has two sides, each represented as a separate container (`self.left` and `self.right`). This design allows for objects to be placed on either side of the scale, facilitating the weighing process. Each side being a container means it can hold multiple objects, and the game can calculate the total mass of objects on each side to determine the scale's balance.\n\n3. **Balance Determination**: The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a description of the balance scale, including which side is heavier or if the scale is in balance. This is determined by comparing the total mass of objects on each side. The method `get_mass` calculates the total mass for a given side by summing the weight of all contained objects. This functionality is critical for the balance scale's purpose in the game, allowing players to understand the result of their actions when using the scale to weigh objects.\n\n4. **Interaction Restrictions**: The methods `placeObjectInContainer` and `takeObjectFromContainer` override the default container behavior to restrict direct placement or removal of objects from the balance scale itself. Instead, objects must be placed on or taken from one of the two sides. This restriction is critical for maintaining the logical operation of a balance scale in the game, ensuring that players interact with it in a manner consistent with its real-world counterpart.\n\n5. **Recursive Object Retrieval**: The method `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive` allows for the retrieval of all objects placed on both sides of the scale, including those within other containers on the scale. This functionality is important for scenarios where the game needs to account for or manipulate all objects involved in the weighing process, regardless of their specific location on the scale.\n\nIn summary, the BalanceScale class defines a non-moveable object with two sides that can each hold multiple objects. Its critical properties and methods facilitate the realistic operation of a balance scale within the game, allowing for the weighing of objects and providing feedback on the balance state to the player.==========\nObject: Cube\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nweight: the mass of the cube as initialized when the object is created.\n\nThis class, `Cube`, inherits from `GameObject`, indicating it is a basic object within the game environment. The critical property set in the `__init__` method is `weight`, which is directly assigned from the `mass` parameter passed during the object's initialization. This property likely represents the physical weight of the cube, which could affect interactions with other objects or the game environment, such as being too heavy to carry or affecting the player's movement speed if carried.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple string representation of the cube, which does not change based on the object's state or properties beyond its basic identification as a \"cube\". This method's behavior does not vary with the `makeDetailed` flag, indicating that the cube's description remains constant regardless of the level of detail requested.==========\nObject: Weight\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nweight: the mass of the weight object in grams.\n\nThis class defines a `Weight` object that inherits from `GameObject`. The critical property set in the `__init__` method is `weight`, which represents the mass of the weight object in grams. This property is directly set based on the `mass` parameter passed during the object's initialization. The `name_idx` parameter is used to give each weight a unique name by appending it to the string \"weight\", which helps in identifying different weight objects within the game.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method returns a string representation of the weight object, including its mass in grams and its name, providing a simple description that can be used within the game to identify or describe the weight object to the player. There is no `tick` method in this class, so the object's properties do not change over time or with game ticks.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties: None specified as critical within the `__init__` method.\n\nThe `World` class does not explicitly define any new properties within its `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `Container` class. It is designed to represent a room or environment within the game, capable of containing other objects. The critical aspect of this class lies in its ability to organize and describe the objects it contains, rather than in specific properties like temperature or openability.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual representation of the world (or room) and lists the objects it contains. This method enhances the game's narrative by dynamically generating descriptions based on the current state of the room, including the objects present. However, since there's no `tick` method defined within the `World` class, there's no behavior specified for how the properties of the world or its contained objects might change over time with each game tick.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, there are no specific critical properties to explain based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class is designed to represent an agent (e.g., a player or NPC) within the game. It inherits from the `Container` class, which suggests that the agent can hold or contain other objects, similar to how a player might carry items in an inventory.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this method is likely used to identify the agent within the game's narrative or command parsing system. This could be useful for commands or descriptions that refer to the player or agent themselves.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is likely used to generate a textual description of the agent. The `makeDetailed` parameter is available but not used in the provided implementation, suggesting that there could be a more detailed description option available for future expansion or within other parts of the game that are not shown here.\n\nSince there is no `tick` method defined in the provided class, there is no behavior described that changes the object's properties at each game tick.==========\n",
    "refrigerate-food": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class and does not inherit from any other classes)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other items within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects can be relocated within the game environment.\n- temperature: Sets the initial temperature of the object to 20 degrees Celsius. This property implies that objects in the game have a temperature attribute, which can be relevant for game mechanics involving heat or cold.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. These include the ability to track the object's name and unique identifier (UUID), manage containment relationships (i.e., whether an object is inside another object), and handle basic property management (e.g., setting, getting, and checking properties).\n\nThe class also includes methods for adding and removing objects from containers, suggesting that objects can have parent-child relationships where one object can \"contain\" another. This is critical for game mechanics involving inventory management or spatial organization.\n\nThe `tick` method is defined but does not perform any actions. In derived classes, this method can be overridden to implement behavior that occurs at each game tick, such as updating the object's state or interacting with other objects.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a way to generate a human-readable description of the object, which can be used for displaying information to the player. By default, it returns the object's name, but this can be overridden in derived classes to provide more detailed descriptions.\n\nOverall, the `GameObject` class is designed to be a versatile and extendable base for all objects within the game, providing essential attributes and behaviors that can be customized or extended in derived classes to create a rich and interactive game world.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container, which means it can hold other objects.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property affects whether objects can be placed in or taken out of the container without changing its state.\n- isOpen: Specifies if the container is currently open or closed. This state affects the ability to add or remove objects from the container.\n- containerPrefix: This is a textual prefix used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" the box).\n\nThe `Container` class also includes methods for interacting with the container, such as opening and closing it, and adding or removing objects. These interactions are contingent upon the properties of the container (e.g., whether it's openable, whether it's currently open).\n\nThe `tick` method in this class simulates heat transfer between the container and the objects inside it. At each game tick, the temperature of objects within the container will adjust towards the temperature of the container itself, with a maximum change per tick defined. This simulates a realistic behavior where the contents of a container gradually equilibrate to the container's temperature, either cooling down or warming up as necessary. This feature adds a layer of dynamic interaction in the game, where the state of objects can change over time based on environmental conditions.==========\nObject: Device\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isDevice: Indicates that this object is a device. This property is set to True, meaning that within the game's context, it can be recognized and interacted with as a device.\n- isActivatable: Determines whether the device can be turned on or off. This is set to True, indicating that the device has functionality that allows it to change states between being active (on) and inactive (off).\n- isOn: Represents the current state of the device, whether it is on or off. Initially set to False, indicating that devices start in the off state.\n\nMethods:\n- turnOn(): This method attempts to turn the device on. If the device is not activatable or is already on, it returns an error message and a success flag set to False. If successful, it changes the `isOn` property to True and returns a success message with a success flag set to True.\n- turnOff(): Similar to `turnOn()`, but for turning the device off. It checks if the device is activatable and if it is already off. If it can be turned off, it sets `isOn` to False and returns a success message.\n- useWithObject(patientObject): This method provides a template for interacting with another object (referred to as `patientObject`). By default, it returns a message indicating uncertainty about how to use the device with the specified object, along with a success flag set to False. This method can be overridden in subclasses to implement specific interactions.\n- makeDescriptionStr(makeDetailed=False): Generates a human-readable description of the device, including its name and whether it is currently on or off. This method enhances the game's user interface by providing clear information about the device's state.\n\nThe `Device` class, through its properties and methods, defines a generic device within the game. It sets the foundation for more specific devices by providing basic functionality such as turning on and off, and it allows for interaction with other objects, although the specifics of such interactions are left to be defined by subclasses.==========\nObject: Fridge\nInherits: Container, Device\n\nProperties:\n- isOpenable: Indicates that a fridge can be opened, which is true for this object.\n- isOpen: Reflects whether the fridge is initially closed at the start of the simulation.\n- isMoveable: Suggests that the fridge is too heavy to move, aligning with real-world expectations of a fridge's portability.\n- isOn: States that the fridge is always on, a common scenario in real life where fridges run continuously to preserve food.\n- isActivatable: Indicates that the fridge does not have an on/off switch accessible for gameplay purposes, which is typical since fridges are rarely turned off manually.\n- minTemperature: The minimum temperature the fridge can cool its contents to, set at 4.0 degrees Celsius. This property is critical for gameplay involving food preservation or tasks requiring specific temperatures.\n- tempDecreasePerTick: The rate at which the temperature decreases per game tick for items inside the fridge, set at 5.0 degrees Celsius. This property is crucial for simulating the cooling effect of the fridge on its contents over time.\n\nTick Method Functionality:\n- The tick method decreases the temperature of items inside the fridge, but only if the fridge is on and closed. This simulates the realistic behavior of a fridge cooling its contents. The temperature of each item is decreased by the `tempDecreasePerTick` value, down to the `minTemperature` limit. This ensures that items do not freeze or become colder than the fridge's set minimum temperature, reflecting a realistic and controlled cooling environment within the fridge.\n\nDescription Generation (`makeDescriptionStr`):\n- This method generates a human-readable description of the fridge, including its current state (on/off, open/closed), and its contents if any. The description changes based on whether the fridge is open or closed and whether it contains any items. If the fridge is open, the description will list the items inside it. If the fridge is off, which is unlikely given its default state, this will also be mentioned, adding depth to the game's narrative and interaction possibilities.==========\nObject: FoodItem\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- foodPrefix: This is the prefix used when referring to the food item, which helps in creating a more natural and contextually appropriate description of the food item (e.g., \"a\", \"some\", \"the\").\n- isFood: A boolean property that identifies the object as food. This is critical for interactions that are specific to food items, such as eating.\n- spoilTime: This property defines the duration (in game steps) that the food item can remain above its maximum temperature before it spoils. It's a measure of the food's perishability.\n- maxTemperature: The maximum temperature (in degrees Celsius) that the food item can be exposed to before it begins to spoil. This property is crucial for gameplay mechanics involving cooking or storing food.\n- timeAboveMaxTemp: Tracks the number of game steps the food item has been above its maximum temperature. This property is used to determine when the food spoils.\n- isSpoiled: Indicates whether the food item has spoiled. This affects the item's usability and possibly the player's health if consumed.\n- isAboveMaxTemp: A boolean that indicates whether the food item's current temperature exceeds its maximum temperature. This property is used to trigger the spoilage process.\n\nTick Method:\n- The tick method updates the food item's state with each game tick. It checks if the food item's current temperature exceeds its maximum temperature. If so, it marks the item as being above the maximum temperature and increments the time it has been in this state.\n- If the food item remains above its maximum temperature for a duration exceeding its spoilTime, the item is marked as spoiled. This changes how the item can be interacted with in the game (e.g., it may no longer be edible or may have different effects if consumed).\n- The tick method's functionality is critical for simulating the perishability of food items in the game, adding a layer of complexity to food management and survival strategies.==========\nObject: Counter\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- isOpenable: This property indicates that a counter, unlike some other objects in the game, cannot be opened or closed. It is essentially a flat surface that is always open, reflecting the real-world characteristic of a kitchen counter or similar surfaces where items can be placed but not enclosed.\n- isMoveable: This property signifies that the counter is too heavy to be moved. This is typical for counters which are usually fixed pieces of furniture or fixtures in a room, designed to hold other objects but not to be relocated easily.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a dynamic description of the counter based on its contents. If the counter has items on it, the method enumerates these items, appending \"and\" before the last item for proper grammar, and then states these items are \"on it,\" using the `containerPrefix` property. If the counter is empty, it simply states that the counter is empty. This method allows for a detailed description of the counter's state, which can be useful for players to understand their environment and the objects within it more clearly.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is designed to represent a \"world\" or environment within the game, with the initial example being a kitchen. The critical aspect of this class lies in its ability to contain other objects, as indicated by its inheritance from the Container class, and how it describes its contents.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the world and its contents. If the world contains other objects, it lists them by calling each object's `makeDescriptionStr` method, which allows for a detailed or simple description based on the `makeDetailed` flag. This method enhances the game's narrative by providing a dynamic description of the environment based on the objects it contains, contributing to the immersive experience of the game. However, without a `tick` method, this class does not modify its properties or the properties of contained objects over time in response to game ticks.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `GameObject` and `Container` classes. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no specific critical properties to discuss. However, it's worth noting the unique aspects of this class as they relate to its role in the game.\n\nThe `Agent` class represents an entity in the game that can contain other objects, as indicated by its inheritance from the `Container` class. This suggests that the agent can carry or hold items, which is a common feature for player characters or NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in text-based games.\n\nThe `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, which implies that this class is intended to represent the player or an NPC from a first-person perspective. This method could be used in the game's parsing system to recognize references to the player or the NPC when interpreting player commands or script actions.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`. This method is likely used to generate a description of the agent when the game needs to display who or what is being interacted with or observed. The lack of a detailed description (regardless of the `makeDetailed` flag) suggests that the agent's identity is either self-evident within the game's context or that further identity details are handled elsewhere in the game's code.\n\nIn summary, the `Agent` class is designed to represent a game character that can carry items and is referred to from a first-person perspective. The class does not introduce new critical properties but utilizes its inheritance from the `Container` class to allow the agent to hold other objects. The methods provided give a basic framework for referring to and describing the agent within the game.==========\n",
    "multimeter": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting they can be relocated within the game environment unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common across various types of objects. It includes mechanisms for handling object identification (through a unique ID or UUID), containment (whether an object can contain other objects and the management of such containment), and basic property management (setting, getting, and checking properties).\n\nThe class also includes methods for:\n- Safely getting a property value with `getProperty`, which returns `None` if the property does not exist, ensuring the game does not crash due to missing properties.\n- Adding or removing objects from this object's containment list with `addObject` and `removeObject`, which also automatically handles updating the parent container reference of the moved object.\n- Recursively getting all contained objects with `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive`, allowing for operations on an object and all objects it contains.\n- Finding contained objects by name with `containsItemWithName`, useful for identifying specific objects within a container without needing to know their exact ID.\n- Performing updates at each game tick with `tick`, although by default, this method does nothing and is meant to be overridden by subclasses that need to perform periodic updates.\n- Generating a human-readable description of the object with `makeDescriptionStr`, which by default, returns the object's name but can be overridden to provide more detailed descriptions.\n\nThe `GameObject` class does not inherently change any properties at each game tick since the `tick` method is implemented as a pass-through function. This behavior is intended for subclasses to override where necessary, to define their own behavior that occurs as the game progresses.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container, which means it can hold other objects. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other items within the game, affecting how players can interact with it.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects whether or not players can access the contents of the container. If it's not openable, it implies the contents are always accessible (if open) or never accessible (if closed and cannot be opened).\n- isOpen: Specifies if the container is currently open or closed, assuming it is openable. This is a critical property as it directly impacts the ability to place objects in or take objects out of the container. The accessibility of the container's contents to the player or other game elements depends on this property.\n- containerPrefix: This property defines how the container is referred to in the game's narrative context (e.g., \"in the box\", \"on the table\"). It's critical for generating descriptive text that accurately reflects the spatial relationship between the container and its contents.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the isOpen property based on the conditions met.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method also directly manipulates the isOpen property.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game's state by changing the location of an object to within the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently inside the container. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken, and a success flag. This method changes the game's state by altering the location of an object from within the container to outside of it.\n\nThe Container class, through its properties and methods, provides a foundational mechanism for interacting with objects that can hold other objects within the game. It defines how objects can be stored, accessed, and manipulated, which is essential for creating complex interactions and puzzles in the game world.==========\nObject: ElectricalObject\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- is_electrical_object: Indicates that the object is an electrical object. This is a boolean property set to True, distinguishing it from non-electrical objects within the game.\n- conductive: A boolean indicating whether the object can conduct electricity. This is critical for determining if electrical current can pass through this object.\n- resistance: Represents the electrical resistance of the object in ohms. This property affects how easily electricity can flow through the object, impacting the game's simulation of electrical circuits.\n- connects: A dictionary with keys \"terminal1\" and \"terminal2\", each potentially holding a tuple (object, terminal). This property represents the electrical connections of the object to other objects. The value is a tuple where the first element is the object connected to and the second element is the terminal of that object used for the connection. This setup allows for the simulation of complex electrical circuits within the game.\n\nThe `disconnect` method allows for the disconnection of this object from another by setting the relevant terminal in the `connects` dictionary to None, and also updating the connected object's `connects` property to reflect the disconnection. This method is critical for dynamically changing the configuration of electrical circuits within the game.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the object, detailing its name and its connections based on the state of its `connects` property. This method provides a textual representation of the object's current electrical connections, which can be used for displaying information to the player or debugging purposes.==========\nObject: Multimeter\nInherits: ElectricalObject\nProperties:\n- mode: The multimeter can operate in three modes: voltage, current, and resistance. This property determines the mode in which the multimeter is currently set. The mode affects how the multimeter interacts with the electrical circuit in the game.\n\nThe `Multimeter` class inherits from `ElectricalObject`, indicating it is designed to interact with electrical components within the game environment. The initialization of the `Multimeter` object sets critical properties based on its mode:\n\n1. **Conductivity and Resistance Initialization**: At the beginning of the `__init__` method, there's a conditional check on the mode to set the `conductive` and `resistance` properties before calling the `ElectricalObject` constructor. This setup suggests that the multimeter's electrical behavior (whether it's conductive and its resistance value) is determined by its mode. However, there's a logical error in the condition `if mode == 'current' or 'resistance':` which will always evaluate to `True` because the correct way to check this condition would be `if mode == 'current' or mode == 'resistance':`. As written, the multimeter is always initialized as conductive with zero resistance, which might not be the intended behavior for modes other than 'current' or 'resistance'.\n\n2. **Mode Property**: The `mode` property is critical as it determines how the multimeter functions within the game. It can be set to measure voltage, current, or resistance. This property directly influences the behavior of the `measure` method.\n\n3. **Measure Method**: This method simulates the measurement process of the multimeter based on its current mode. \n   - In 'voltage' and 'current' modes, it always returns 0 with the respective unit ('V' for volts and 'A' for amperes), reflecting the game's simplification that there are no power sources, and thus, no voltage or current to measure.\n   - In 'resistance' mode, it calculates the total resistance of a serial circuit by traversing through connected electrical objects until it either completes the circuit back to itself, encounters a non-conductive object, or finds an object that doesn't connect to anything further. The total resistance is the sum of the resistances of all conductive objects in the loop unless a non-conductive object is encountered, in which case the total resistance is considered infinite ('inf').\n\n4. **makeDescriptionStr Method**: This method provides a textual description of the multimeter, including its mode and the measurement result. It uses the `measure` method to get the current reading and formats it into a string that describes the multimeter's state and measurement in the game context.\n\nIn summary, the `Multimeter` object in the game is designed to simulate the functionality of a real-world multimeter within the constraints of the game's electrical system. Its behavior and interactions are primarily determined by its mode, affecting how it measures and interacts with other electrical objects in the game environment.==========\nObject: Wire\nInherits: ElectricalObject\nProperties:\nis_wire: This property indicates that the object is indeed a wire, distinguishing it from other types of electrical objects in the game. This could be critical for game mechanics that require the identification of wires for electrical connections or puzzles. \n\nSince there is no `tick` method defined in the `Wire` class, there's no need to describe changes to the object properties at each game tick.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. The critical aspect of this class is its role as a container for other objects, implying it can hold multiple objects within it, similar to how a room can contain various items or entities.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a string description of the world (or room) and lists all contained objects. This method enhances the interaction with the game by providing a textual representation of what the player sees in the room, including a detailed list of items if `makeDetailed` is set to True. However, there are no properties directly modified or affected by game ticks within this class, as it lacks a `tick` method to alter properties over time.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from `GameObject` and `Container`. Therefore, based on the provided code, there are no specific critical properties to discuss. However, it's worth noting the unique aspects of this class as follows:\n\n1. **Identity as \"agent\"**: The `Agent` class is initialized with the identity \"agent\" for both the `GameObject` and `Container` aspects. This suggests that the object represents an agent (likely the player or an NPC) within the game, capable of containing other objects, akin to carrying items.\n\n2. **Self-referential Description**: Both the `getReferents` and `makeDescriptionStr` methods return values that refer to the agent itself (\"yourself\"). This implies that the agent is designed to be self-referential within the game's narrative or description logic. When the game needs to refer to the agent or describe it, it will simply use \"yourself,\" enhancing the immersion or personalization of the game experience.\n\n3. **Lack of a `tick` Method**: Since there is no `tick` method defined within the `Agent` class, there are no properties that change at each game tick explicitly defined in this class. This absence suggests that any dynamic behavior or property changes of the agent over time (e.g., health, status effects) would need to be handled elsewhere in the game's code or through other mechanisms not shown in the provided class definition.\n\nIn summary, the `Agent` class represents a self-referential entity within the game, capable of containing other objects but without explicitly defined critical properties or dynamic behavior specified in the given code snippet.==========\n",
    "bath-tub-water-temperature": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, which means they cannot hold other items unless this property is set to True.\n- isMoveable: Specifies if the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, allowing them to be picked up or relocated within the game environment.\n- isUsable: Determines if the object can be used for an action. By default, objects are not usable, meaning they don't have a specific function or action associated with them unless this property is set to True.\n- isActivatable: Indicates whether the object can be activated or turned on/off. By default, objects are not activatable, which means they don't have an on/off state or similar binary states unless this property is set to True.\n- temperature: Sets the initial temperature of the object to 20 degrees Celsius. This property suggests that the game might simulate temperature effects or require temperature management for certain objects or environments.\n\nMethods:\n- The `getProperty` method allows for the safe retrieval of an object's property, returning None if the property does not exist. This method ensures that accessing a property that hasn't been set won't cause an error.\n- The `addObject` and `removeObject` methods manage the containment relationship between objects. `addObject` adds an object to this container (if it is one) and sets the object's parent container to this object. `removeObject` does the opposite, removing an object from this container and clearing its parent container property.\n- The `removeSelfFromContainer` method allows an object to remove itself from its current container, if any. This could be used when an object is picked up or moved by a player or another object.\n- The `getAllContainedObjectsRecursive` method retrieves all objects contained within this object, including those nested within other contained objects, allowing for a deep search of the containment hierarchy.\n- The `containsItemWithName` method checks for the presence of an object with a specific name directly within this object, without searching nested containers.\n- The `tick` method is a placeholder in this class, meant to be overridden in subclasses to define behavior that occurs at each game tick, such as updating object states or triggering events.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list of names or identifiers that can be used to refer to this object within the game, starting with its name and ID.\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method generates a human-readable description of the object, which can be detailed or simple depending on the `makeDetailed` flag. This could be used to provide players with information about objects they encounter or interact with in the game.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container, meaning it can hold other objects. This is a critical property as it defines the object's ability to contain other items within the game world.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property for gameplay, as it dictates whether the contents of the container are accessible to the player.\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of items relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for items inside the container). This property is critical for generating descriptive text about where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly affects the 'isOpen' property by setting it to True if the container is successfully opened.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly affects the 'isOpen' property by setting it to False if the container is successfully closed.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game state by changing the location of an object to be within the container.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open and the object is moveable and contained within. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken, and a boolean flag indicating success. This method affects the game state by changing the location of an object to be outside the container.\n\nThe Container class, through its properties and methods, provides a foundational mechanism for objects in the game world that can hold other objects. It enables complex interactions such as opening, closing, placing items into, and taking items out of containers, which are essential for creating an interactive and immersive game environment.==========\nObject: Tap\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- isActivatable: Indicates that the tap can be turned on or off, signifying its ability to be activated or deactivated.\n- isOn: Reflects whether the tap is currently on or off, controlling the flow of water.\n- isMoveable: A tap is fixed in place and cannot be moved, indicating its permanent installation in the game environment.\n- water_temperature: The temperature of the water that comes out of the tap when it is turned on, affecting the environment or objects it interacts with.\n\nThe `turnOn` and `turnOff` methods allow the tap to be activated or deactivated, respectively, with each method providing feedback on the action's success and changing the `isOn` property accordingly.\n\nThe `tick` method simulates the passage of time and its effect on the game environment when the tap is on. If the tap is on and it is placed within a `BathTub` (assuming `BathTub` and `Water` are defined elsewhere in the game code), it will either add water to the bathtub if there is none or adjust the temperature of the existing water towards the tap's water temperature. This adjustment is done by either increasing or decreasing the water's temperature by 5 degrees Celsius per tick, without exceeding the tap's water temperature. This dynamic interaction introduces a realistic element to the game, where the tap can fill a bathtub and influence the temperature of the water within it, affecting any game mechanics related to water temperature or volume.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a human-readable description of the tap, indicating its current state (on or off), which can be used to inform the player about the status of the tap within the game's narrative or user interface.==========\nObject: Thermometer\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- isUsable: Indicates that the thermometer can be used in the game. This is a critical property because it defines the thermometer's primary function within the game environment, which is to measure and read temperatures.\n\nThe `Thermometer` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there are no properties that change at each game tick to describe.\n\nThe `useWithObject` method allows the thermometer to interact with other objects in the game to read their temperature, except for `Agent` objects or itself (`Thermometer` objects), which is a logical restriction preventing nonsensical interactions. This method showcases the thermometer's functionality of reading temperatures, which is its critical feature in the game. The method returns a string with the temperature reading if the interaction is valid, enhancing the game's interactivity and realism by allowing players to measure temperatures of various objects, contributing to puzzle-solving or exploration elements within the game.==========\nObject: Water\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\n- isMoveable: Indicates that water, being a liquid, cannot be moved in the same manner as solid objects within the game. This property is set to False to reflect its immovable nature.\n- temperature: Represents the current temperature of the water in degrees Celsius. This is a critical property as it can affect interactions with other objects in the game, such as changing state when heated or cooled to certain temperatures.==========\nObject: BathTub\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- containerPrefix: Indicates the preposition used to describe where items are in relation to the bath tub, which is \"in\" in this case. This means when describing items contained within the bath tub, the description will use \"in\" to indicate their location (e.g., \"in the bath tub\").\n- isMoveable: This property is set to False, indicating that the bath tub cannot be moved. This is logical for a bath tub as they are typically large, heavy, and fixed in place in a bathroom setting.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the bath tub and its contents. If the bath tub is empty, it simply states that the bath tub is empty. If there are items in the bath tub, it lists those items, using the `containerPrefix` (\"in\") to describe their location relative to the bath tub. This method adjusts its output based on whether a detailed description is requested or not, but in the provided code, the detailed flag does not alter the behavior significantly other than potentially affecting how item descriptions are generated by the `makeDescriptionStr` method of the contained objects.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the Container class. It is initialized with a specific name (\"bathroom\"), indicating that this instance of World is representing a bathroom environment within the game.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a textual description of the World object's current state, specifically tailored for when the World is a bathroom. This method iterates over all objects contained within the World (in this case, the bathroom) and appends their descriptions to the output string. Each object's description is indented for readability, and if `makeDetailed` is True, it could potentially provide more detailed descriptions of each contained object, depending on how those objects implement their `makeDescriptionStr` methods. However, the provided code snippet does not show any differentiation based on the `makeDetailed` parameter, nor does it modify any properties or involve a tick method to describe changes over time.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method beyond what is inherited from the `GameObject` and `Container` classes. Therefore, there are no specific critical properties to discuss based on the provided code snippet.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The `Agent` class is designed to represent an agent (e.g., a player character or an NPC) within the game. It inherits from the `Container` class, which suggests that the agent can hold or contain other objects, similar to how a player might carry items in an inventory.\n- The `getReferents` method returns a list containing the string `\"yourself\"`, indicating that this method is likely used to refer to the agent within the game's narrative or command parsing system. This could be useful for commands or descriptions that involve the player directly, such as \"look at yourself\" or \"inventory\".\n- The `makeDescriptionStr` method, when called, simply returns the string `\"yourself\"`, whether the `makeDetailed` flag is set to `True` or `False`. This suggests that the agent's description is static and does not change based on context or the level of detail requested. This method could be part of a system that generates text descriptions for objects within the game world.\n\nSince there is no `tick` method defined in the provided class, there are no properties that change at each game tick to discuss.==========\n",
    "sunburn": "Object: GameObject\nInherits: None (This is a base class)\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates whether the object can contain other objects. By default, objects are not containers, meaning they cannot hold other objects within them unless this property is explicitly changed.\n- isMoveable: Specifies whether the object can be moved. By default, objects are moveable, suggesting that unless otherwise specified, objects in the game can be relocated by the player or by other means.\n\nThe `GameObject` class serves as a foundational class for objects within the game, providing basic properties and methods that are common to all objects. It includes mechanisms for handling unique identifiers (UUIDs), naming, containment (both holding other objects and being contained within another object), and property management. The class also outlines a basic structure for updating object states during game ticks, though the default implementation does nothing and is intended to be overridden by subclasses as needed.\n\nCritical to understanding the `GameObject` class is its approach to multiple inheritance and constructor management. The class uses a `constructorsRun` list to prevent its constructor from executing multiple times when inherited alongside other classes. This mechanism ensures that the initialization logic specific to `GameObject` (such as assigning a UUID and setting default properties) only runs once, even if a subclass inherits from multiple parents that also inherit from `GameObject`.\n\nThe class also provides utility methods for interacting with the object's properties and contained objects. These include safely getting a property value, adding or removing objects from the object's containment list, and generating lists of contained objects either flatly or recursively. Additionally, methods are provided for identifying objects by name and for generating a basic textual description of the object, which can be used for debugging or display purposes in the game.\n\nIn summary, the `GameObject` class lays the groundwork for all objects within the game, providing essential attributes and behaviors that are common across various types of objects. Its design facilitates extensibility and reuse, allowing for the creation of more complex objects and behaviors through inheritance and method overriding.==========\nObject: Container\nInherits: GameObject\n\nProperties:\n- isContainer: Indicates that the object is a container. This is a critical property because it defines the object's ability to contain other objects, distinguishing it from non-container objects in the game.\n- isOpenable: Determines whether the container can be opened or closed. This property is critical because it affects how players can interact with the container (e.g., whether they can open it to access its contents).\n- isOpen: Reflects the current state of the container, whether it is open or closed. This is a critical property because it directly impacts what actions can be performed with or on the container (e.g., placing objects inside it or taking objects from it).\n- containerPrefix: Specifies the preposition used to describe the location of objects relative to the container (e.g., \"in\" for a box, \"on\" for a table). This property is critical for generating accurate and context-appropriate descriptions of where objects are located in the game world.\n\nMethods:\n- openContainer: Attempts to open the container if it is openable and currently closed. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method directly manipulates the `isOpen` property based on the conditions met.\n- closeContainer: Attempts to close the container if it is openable and currently open. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method also directly manipulates the `isOpen` property.\n- placeObjectInContainer: Tries to place an object inside the container if the container is open and the object is moveable. It returns a message indicating success or failure, along with a boolean flag. This method affects the game state by potentially adding an object to the container's contents.\n- takeObjectFromContainer: Attempts to remove an object from the container if the container is open, the object is moveable, and the object is currently inside the container. It returns a message, a reference to the object being taken (if successful), and a boolean flag. This method changes the game state by potentially removing an object from the container's contents.\n\nThe `Container` class, by inheriting from `GameObject`, gains all the properties and methods of a generic game object, with additional properties and methods specific to objects that can contain other objects. The critical properties define how the container behaves in terms of its ability to hold other objects, whether it can be opened or closed, and how it is described in relation to objects it contains. The methods provided allow for dynamic interaction with the container, such as opening, closing, adding, and removing contents, which can affect the game state and how players interact with the game world.==========\nObject: Room\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- is_outdoor: Indicates whether the room is outdoors or not. This could affect various gameplay elements, such as weather effects or the types of creatures encountered.\n- connects: A list of other rooms that this room connects to. This property is critical for navigation within the game, allowing players to move between different rooms based on the connections defined here.\n\nThe `Room` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there's no need to describe changes to the object properties at each game tick.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a detailed description of the room, including its name, the objects it contains, and its connections to other rooms. This method enhances the immersive experience by dynamically generating descriptions based on the room's current state, such as which objects are present and which other rooms it connects to.\n\nThe `connectsTo` method checks if the room is connected to another specified room, facilitating the implementation of navigation logic within the game by determining if the player can move directly from one room to another based on the existing connections.==========\nObject: World\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- This class does not explicitly define any critical properties within the `__init__` method as seen in the provided example. However, it is designed to represent a \"world\" within a text-based game, inheriting from a \"Container\" class. This suggests that the \"World\" object can contain other objects, similar to how a container can hold items. The critical aspect of this class lies in its ability to organize and describe the spatial arrangement and contents of rooms within the game world.\n\nThe `makeDescriptionStr` method:\n- This method is critical for providing a textual description of a room within the world. It takes a `room` object and an optional `makeDetailed` boolean flag as arguments.\n- The method starts by describing the room's name, indicating the player's current location within the world.\n- It then iterates over the objects contained within the room (`room.contains`), appending a description of each object to the output string. This part of the method is responsible for listing the items or features present in the room, enhancing the player's immersion by detailing the environment.\n- Additionally, the method describes connections to other rooms. It accesses the `room.properties[\"connects\"]` to list all possible exits or pathways leading out of the current room, providing the player with information on how to navigate the world.\n\nIn summary, while the `World` class does not define specific properties like `maxTemperature` or `tempIncreasePerTick` as seen in the `Stove` example, it plays a crucial role in structuring the game world and enhancing player interaction through descriptive text. It organizes rooms and their contents, and details connections between different locations, thereby facilitating exploration and interaction within the game environment.==========\nObject: Items\nInherits: GameObject\nProperties:\nusable: Indicates whether the item can be used in the game. In this case, items are by default usable.\n\nThe `Items` class does not contain a `tick` method, so there is no behavior to describe that changes the object properties at each game tick. The `makeDescriptionStr` method provides a simple description of the item, incorporating its name into the description, which suggests that items can have different names and are identified as a \"bottle of\" followed by their name in the game's narrative context.==========\nObject: Agent\nInherits: Container\n\nProperties:\n- use_sunscreen: Indicates whether the agent is using sunscreen. This is a boolean value that affects whether the agent gets sunburned.\n- sunburn: Indicates whether the agent has gotten sunburned. This is a boolean value that changes based on the agent's exposure to outdoor conditions without sunscreen.\n\nThe `tick` method function of the Agent class checks if the agent is outdoors (by checking the `is_outdoor` property of the agent's parent container) and if the agent is not using sunscreen (`use_sunscreen` property is False). If both conditions are met, the agent gets sunburned (`sunburn` property is set to True). This means that at each game tick, if the agent is outdoors without sunscreen, their `sunburn` property will change to True, indicating they have gotten sunburned.==========\n"
