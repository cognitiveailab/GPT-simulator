Task Description: Your task is to change all fossil-fuel power stations to use renewable energy while keeping the same capacity.

Initial Observation: You are in charge of 4 regions. Modify power plants in the regions to use clean energy.
        region 0 (ID: 1) has enough sunshine all year round. It has a fossil-fuel power station (ID: 2), whose current generation capasity is 1000kW and is at 100% efficiency.
        region 1 (ID: 3) is near a large river. It has a fossil-fuel power station (ID: 4), whose current generation capasity is 1000kW and is at 100% efficiency.
        region 2 (ID: 5) is near a large river. It has a fossil-fuel power station (ID: 6), whose current generation capasity is 1000kW and is at 100% efficiency.
        region 3 (ID: 7) has steady wind. It has a fossil-fuel power station (ID: 8), whose current generation capasity is 1000kW and is at 100% efficiency.
