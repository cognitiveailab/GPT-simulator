Task Description: Your task is to figure out if the fork is conductive or not. If the fork is conductive, put it in the red box. Otherwise, put it in the black box.

Initial Observation: You find yourself in a room.  In the room, you see:
        yourself
        a light bulb (ID: 2) which is off
        a red wire (ID: 3)
        a black wire (ID: 4)
        a blue wire (ID: 5)
        a battery (ID: 6)
        a fork (ID: 7)
        the red box (ID: 8)
        the black box (ID: 9)
