Task Description: Your task is to figure out the resistance of the resistor 0.

Initial Observation: You find yourself in a room.  In the room, you see:
        yourself
        a multimeter (ID: 2), which is in voltage mode and reads 0V
        a resistor 0 (ID: 3)
        a resistor 1 (ID: 4)
        a red wire (ID: 5)
        a black wire (ID: 6)
        a blue wire (ID: 7)


Type 'help' for a list of possible actions.

> set multimeter (ID: 2) to resistance mode
Observation: You set the multimeter to the resistance mode.
