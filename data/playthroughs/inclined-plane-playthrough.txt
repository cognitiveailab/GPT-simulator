Task Description: Here are two inclined planes with the same angle. Your task is figure out which of the two inclined planes has the most friction. Focus on the inclined plane with the most friction after your experiment.

Initial Observation: You find yourself in a workshop.  In the workshop, you see:
        yourself
        an inclined plane 1 (ID: 2)
        an inclined plane 2 (ID: 3)
        block (ID: 4)
        a stopwatch (ID: 5), which is deactivated


Type 'help' for a list of possible actions.

> take stopwatch (ID: 5)
