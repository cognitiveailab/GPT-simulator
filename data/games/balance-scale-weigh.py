# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models weighing an object using a balance scale.
# Environment: room
# Task-critical Objects: BalanceScale, Cube, Weight
# High-level object classes: None
# Critical properties: left (BalanceScale, the left side of the balance scale), right (BalanceScale, the right side of the balance scale), weight (Cube, Weight)
# Actions: look, inventory, take/put object, answer
# Distractor Items: Cube
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: take the target cube, put the cube on one side of the balance scale, add or remove weights to the other side of the balance scale till the scale is in balance
