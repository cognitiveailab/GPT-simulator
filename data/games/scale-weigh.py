# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models weighing an object with a scale.
# Environment: room
# Task-critical Objects: TestObject, Scale
# High-level object classes: Container (Scale)
# Critical properties: weight (TestObject)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, answer
# Distractor Items: TestObject
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: take the target object, put the target object on the scale, read the scale and answer
