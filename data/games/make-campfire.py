# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to make campfire.
# Environment: forest
# Task-critical Objects: FirePit, Match, Axe, Tree
# High-level object classes: Container (FirePit), Device (Match, Axe)
# Critical properties: isCombustible (Axe, Tree), isChoppable (Tree)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, open/close container, turn on/off device, use device on object
# Distractor Items: None
# Distractor Actions: open, turn on/off
# High-level solution procedure: take the axe, use the axe on the tree, use the axe on the chopped down tree, take the firewood, put the firewood in the fire pit, take the match, use the match on the fire pit
