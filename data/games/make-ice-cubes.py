# make-ice-cubes.py
# based on boil-water.py
# peter jansen (feb 3/2023)

# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to make ice cubes.
# Environment: kitchen
# Task-critical Objects: Freezer, IceCubeTray, Water, Sink
# High-level object classes: Device (Freezer, Sink), Substance (Water), Container (Freezer, IceCubeTray, Pot)
# Critical properties: minTemperature (Freezer), tempDecreasePerTick (Freezer), temperature (Substance), stateOfMatter (Substance), solidName/liquidName/gasName (Substance), meltingPoint/boilingPoint (Substance)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put object, open/close container, turn on/off device, use X on Y, eat food
# Distractor Items: Food, Pot
# Distractor Actions: eat food
# High-level solution procedure: fill the ice cube tray with water from the sink, put the ice cube tray in the freezer, wait for the water to freeze
